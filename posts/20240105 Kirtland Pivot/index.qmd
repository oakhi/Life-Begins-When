Visited East back in 2005. In July, when kids were out of school.

One of the road trips planned were to Palmyra and Niagara.

We toured all of the sites associated with the founding of the church.

Worked our way down the finger lakes area. To our destination at Corning/Elmira NY.

We were to visit NYC for next few days

We were about 250 miles from NYC

Then my mom asked

> Can we visit Kirtland area instead?

It was nearly 300 miles to Kirtland, plus no planned accommodations.

Mom was persuasive and we made changes as drove due West.

Adults were disappointed as much as kids were.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keeping with traditions we travelled with the food we would consume. We were able to rent a full size van with 8 seats.

We would take turns driving and stop at a park or a school playground to eat the Korean food my mom had prepared.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Importance of doing things unpopular for now.

But that will bless lives.

We toured Kirtland Temple area and various homes nearby.

On the way home, kids admitted, although they didn't agree with the decision. The decision was correct.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My parents lived 15 and 18 more years since that visit East.

We had discussed follow up visits to Nauvoo and another trip to Cumorah region. But it didn't materialize.

That visit to upper NY and Clevelan was the last time we spent time travelling.

I remember it well.

Hope the children remember it as well. Turned out to be a great visit
