Visited East back in 2005.
July when kids were out of school.

One of the visits we planned were to Palmyra and Niagara.

We toured all of the sites near the founding of the church.

Worked our way down the finger lakes area
To our desitnation at Corning/Elmira NY.
We were to visit NYC for next few days

250 miles to NYC
closer to 300 miles to Kirtland


Then my mom asked
Can we visit Kirtland area instead?

It is possible but a headache to change plans.
She was persuasive and we made changes

Turned out to be a great visit
