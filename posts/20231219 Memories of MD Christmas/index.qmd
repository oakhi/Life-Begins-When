Spent 9 years living in a suburban Washington DC area, Maryland.

That was the beginning of our lives in the United States.

Those years can be recalled in terms of where we lived and what school we attended.

Rather, those years were years of association with a unit known as the Carrollton Ward.

That was a great blessing for our Family.

Immigrants seek a better life elsewhere

Mainly for education and economic improvement for future generations, religious liberty, asylum from persecution and family strife.

My family came for 3 out of 4 reasons.

In the end religion became the defining reason.

As an immigrant I learned how to read, write and speak in English through the Prince George's county school system.

However, I learned how to live this life, as a follower of Christ, in a congregation of saints

Figuring out the church schedule was a challenge, since we couldn't understand the announcement. 

We sometimes missed meetings because Stake and General Conferences meant a different location and time.

Others because not understanding the Daylight Savings Time.

Our language improved over the years and Brother Bacon from Terre Haute, IN became our Home Teacher. For the next 5 years, he faithfully visited our home.

We became more involved in the Ward

Not always, but attended the weeknight meetings as well.

That led to participating in Road Shows, summer camps and a church wide celebration.

Summer camps and Father and Sons campout were those rare occasions to see places other than a cityscape

The Sesquicentennial celebration in Roanoke and the surrounding area in 1980 was a defining event for a young person.

The magnitude of participation, from the mid-atlantic areas, as well as the depth of commitment demonstrated by participants made a deep impression.

The Ferrum College and the surrounding areas of Roanoke Conference Center opened up a new chapter for a young immigrant person.

Many Koreans, including our family, attended church in Korea after the War.

For adults, it was a religion.

For a young person, it was a chore to walk to and from church often at night

Hearing wild animals added to the sense of sacrifice and an adventure.

For many of us, Christmas was a foreign tradition.

Snacks or treats offered during Easters and Christmas were definitely highlights.

Then our family, mainly through my mother's conversion, joined another congregation. It was not a popular choice then. But my mother was convinced that it was the right choice for her and the family.

Within 3 years, we were boarding a plane headed for Anchorage. On our way to a new home in the Washington DC area.

I remember gatherings in Maryland at Christmas time.

Was asked to learn Christmas Carol to be sung at the Church. Not exposed to music up until then, I struggled to learn, but I still recall the refrains of `Angels We Have Heard...`

Participated in Christmas Devotional at the Church. Where many difficult concepts were explained in plain, parent-like mannners.

My father became one of the Wisemen at a church play. That participation meant a lot to him and for us.

Recall a Christmas Eve gathering at a home, where people are invited to visit, stay or go according to their schedule. Plenty of goodies were served. Remember thinking, when I have a chance, I want to have a gathering like this.

This and many other gatherings helped me realize what a family centered, the community assisted living was like.

According to Ephesians,

> 19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

Thank you Carrollton Ward Members.
