  From April of 1966 to January of 1970 my father worked in Đà Nẵng, Vietnam.

The employer was [RMK-BRJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMK-BRJ)

The initial contract was for 36 months and he renewed for another 6 months afterwards.

He was able to come home after 18 months, for a well-earned, 휴가, return home.

Not only did the work compensation allowed the family to be debt-free but it also enabled my father to deposit money at the Bank of America.

(this allowed him to apply for an employment at an US company without financial backing)

Dad would say later that this crucible was the financial and spiritual base that we desperately needed.

In many ways, Đà Nẵng, Vietnam, was our Egypt and we are very grateful to God and to our father.
