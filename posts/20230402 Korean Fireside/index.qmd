Met the parents of my mission companion.

The meeting was the post General Conference Korean Fireside hosted by the Korean Ward located in the [Orem Sunset Stake. 1260 S 400 W, Orem, UT 84058](https://goo.gl/maps/K9K92MyYesqxqGzH7)

As long as I can recall, Koreans have always met separately after the conclusion of the General Conference.

I remember as a missionary, seeing a contingent from Korea addressing Korean Saints in the LA area. [LA Olympic Korean Ward. 1209 S Manhattan Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90019](https://goo.gl/maps/hQdrMkvAeuq8dHPNA)

Also during the early 1980s, visitors would meet in the old [7th East Building. 2450 S 600 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84106](https://goo.gl/maps/DiaG6HkGJqysDiMu8)

As the Korean Branch/Ward expanded during the last couple of decades, meetings have been held in various buildings in the Edgemont Area of Provo, as well as in Midvale.

I don't recall much of what was said by speakers in those gatherings.
I do remember meeting old friends and meeting new acquaintances
A warm feeling of being with fellow believers and hearing comforting words in language of my father and mother.


Any other group would say 5 sessions and nearly 10 hours of gospel-centered messages would be sufficient.

Not Koreans.

They want to hear directly from their leaders
A statement of those principles in their native language.
As well as soak up any and all Korea related news.

As a bonus, this year, an Area 70 from Japan attended.
Elder Imai said, he found out that his ancestors were from Korea

Format and people attending has changed over the years.
But there are few families and individuals that did not change over time

My mission companion, Elder Pak, was from North Ogden.
He is the youngest of 6 children and the only son in the family.

Also met the husband of his oldest sister. 김상현. 
He mentioned that E. Pak is doing quite well as an orthopedic surgeon.
Owns 2 hospitals and 2 homes in Buena Park and Huntington Beach.
His daughter chimed in, 
“He is in Peru now, arranging a bike ride back to US”

Thought to myself, my companion has done real well.

Then the daughter mentioned their mother has dementia and has moved in to help out.

If she hadn’t mentioned it, I would not have realized, since she recalled and we talked normally about past events.

As I talked to the father more, I realized he sounded a lot like my own father.

So I ventured and asked where he is from.
He said, he has lived in Incheon but he is originally from 함경도 Hamkyung Do.
Just few miles from my father’s hometown.
(he lived about the same distance as Ogden to Provo).

For a few minutes, thought I was listening to my own father speaking.
That unmistakable pattern or 사투리 (억양 抑揚 or intonation) that only North Koreans from 함경남도 (咸鏡南道) area can express..

Thank you Paks.
Thank you Father.
