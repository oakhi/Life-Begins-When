My son in law (사위) asked if I recognized someone in a photo.

I was to identify the son from a group photo.

Photo consisted of a father, a mother, an older son and the younger son.

The parents seemed to be in their late 30s or early 40s.

Rather than focusing on the son, I looked at the father. And asked,

> Who do I know that resembles the father in this group photo

I was able to identify and recall the son that I had known.

Sons start to look like their fathers

Coincide with time when men are bearing the most burden, from family and society.

They start to feel the weight of being a father and husband themselves.

Or perhaps sons experiences same trials that shaped their father’s lives

Thereby starting to see things from their father’s perspective and even start to think in the same manner.

Last year attended a memorial for a Korean leader

As the son got up to conduct a memorial for his father, who passed away in 2003, he remarked.

> This is not some kind of re-incarnation. This is the son.

But he looked just like his father, during his prime, the years that he was serving as a leader in Korea and thereafter in Provo.

The age when sons start to look like their fathers may vary.

It is inevitable that we will think like and thereby become like our progenitors.

It is written,

> Ye shall know them by their fruits

Then is it possible that if we know the father, we can predict who the children may look like as well as what they may do in this lifetime.
