My son in law (사위) asked if I recognized someone in a photo.

I was to pick out and identify the son from a group photo.

Photo consisted of a father, a mother, an older son and the younger son.

The parents seemed to be in their late 30s or early 40s.

Rather than focusing on the son, I looked at the father. And asked,

> Who do I know that resembles the father in this group photo

I was able to identify and recall the son that I had known.

Sons start to look like their fathers

The transition usually coincide with time when men are bearing the most burden.

Burdens, from personal, family and society.

They start to feel the weight of being a father and husband themselves.

Or at times sons experiences same trials that shaped their father’s lives

Thereby starting to see things from their father’s perspective and even start to think in the same manner.

Attended a memorial, last year, for a Korean leader

As the son got up to conduct the memorial of his father, who passed away in 2003, he remarked.

> This is not some kind of re-incarnation. This is the son.

But he looked just like his father, during his father's prime, the years that he was serving as a leader in Korea and thereafter in Provo.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The age when sons start to look like their fathers may vary.

However, it is inevitable that we will think alike and become like our progenitors.

It is written,

> Ye shall know them by their fruits

Then is it possible that if we know the father, we can predict who the children may look like as well as what they may do in this lifetime.

Though I have surpassed the age of transition, I still feel inadequate

My father began to develop skills and earned income during his early teenage years. And he continued to expand his earning capability throughout his life. And he didn't stop working until he was nearly 70 years old.

Was it because he lost his father early in life? Did fighting for a country and survive being captured alter his his outlook? What kept him going? Did he have fear about future?

Was he led by spirit or did he figure things out.
