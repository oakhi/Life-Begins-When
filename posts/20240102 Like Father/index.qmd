My son in law asked if I recognized someone in a photo.

It was to pick out and identify the son from a group photo.
Consisting of a father, a mother, an older son and younger son.
The parents seemed to be in their late 30s or early 40s.

Rather than focusing on the son, I looked at the father.
And asked,

> Who do I know that resembles the father in this group photo

I was able to identify and recall the son.

Sons start to look like their fathers

Usually starting in mid to late 40s.

Coincide with time when men are bearing the most burden, from family and society.

This year attended a memorial for a Korean leader
As the son got up to conduct a memorial for his father, who passed away in 2003, he remarked.
This is not some kind of re-incarnation.
This is the son.

But he looked just like his father, during the prime years that he was serving as a leader in Korea and thereafter in Provo.

At certain age sons start to look like their fathers.
Perhaps because they start to feel the weight of being a father and husband themselves.
Or perhaps sons experiences same trials that shaped their father’s lives
Thereby starting to see things from their father’s perspective and even start to think in the same manner.

The timing of this varies from individual to individual but it probably begins around mid-to-late 40s. – after raising the next generation beyond their teenage years.
