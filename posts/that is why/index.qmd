"Sir, I want to thank you and your fellow countrymen  
for coming to the aid of my country so many years ago.   
Because of your sacrifices, people like me could grow up in freedom!".

My father knew the reason for the war.

Mark A. Wilson's father had to wait 40 years to find the answer.

When my father passed away (Feb 1930 - May 2020) I wrote his life sketch.

It was posted on FB and Mark mentioned his father was born a week earlier and he too served in the Korean War.

I thanked him for the sacrifice and Mark shared the story of how his father learned the meaning of his service in Korea.

Thank you, all those that have served the country, and in particular, during Korean conflict.\
For preserving the freedom for the people of Korea.

> Thank you for your gratitude! My dad died 20 years ago. He never talked about his experiences in South Korea. He refused to answer our questions, even when we asked him directly.

About the only thing he would ever say was how much of a waste of men it was. He claimed he never understood why "kids" his age had to go so far away to kill people.

But, in 1992 my mother died. A year later my dad had remarried and came to DC to "see the sights" with my stepmother.

I volunteered to be their tour guide! One day we were doing the Mall area, visiting the monuments.

Back then, there was a small eatery near the base of the Washington monument. We went there for some lunch.

The three of us sat at a small table in the back. A few minutes later an Asian kid asked if he could join us!

My dad started asking him questions. He was 18 years old and from Busan, South Korea, and was touring the United States.

My dad said, "Oh, I've been to Busan, but it is probably in a lot better shape today!".

Then the kid asked my dad some questions about my dad's experience South Korea, which, surprisingly he answered (this is how I now know my dad was in Busan and Inchon)!

The kid eventually finished his lunch, asked my dad if he could be excused, and took his trash to the garbage can.

Then he came back!?

He stood in front of my dad at attention and saluted him!

He said something like, "Sir, I want to thank you and your fellow countrymen for coming to the aid of my country so many years ago. Because of your sacrifices, people like me could grow up in freedom!".

And, poof! he was gone, lost in the crowds before any of us could say anything.

When I looked at my dad, there was a tear rolling down his face. After a few minutes, he mumbled something like, "So, that is why we go!!!". And, after that he never complained about going "so far away". He still wouldn't answer any questions us kids had, but lunch that day at the base of the Washington monument changed his outlook on life...and his war.

So, it is in this light, I thank you David Kang, for expressing your gratitude! I'm sure, if my dad was alive today, your gratitude would bring another tear to his cheek!!!
