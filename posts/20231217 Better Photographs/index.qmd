On Nov 2014, I took steps to be a better photographer.

## Caught in a Bermuda Triangle

Aperture, Timer, ISO

I couldn't get those straight

Rather than worrying about I just took photos, a lots of it.

Everything was new and took away and premotion or constraints.  
It was liberating

## Equipment Canon 60D with 18~200mm lens

Prosumer but did it job
Especially if one composed by using the Zoom function

## Newest pocket camera

I normally hold on to phones for about 5 years.
No need to upgrade for incremental gains.

But my son convinced me that I need Samsung Ultra 21
It had optical 10X zoom

compared to iPhone 6S it was a huge improvment

It allowed me to compose in a way that was not possible with cell phone camera.

For example, a 10x binoculars magnification is equivalent to a 500mm super-telephoto lens.
