I felt a renewed appreciation and love for my father one morning.

I was thinking how many times he went to work when he preferred to be elsewhere.\
And while working, wishing he had a different vocation.

He never once hinted that his work was hard or difficult.\
He was a crane operator.\
He was able to separate the work from home.

Compartmentalize out of necessity.

When he talked about his Korean War days, we thought he was reliving a period of his life. Only recently we learned that it is one of the traits of a PTSD -- not being able to let go or escape certain events or trials.

Thought of his stay in Vietnam during the 1960s as a work-vacation.\
Forgetting that nation was in a civil war.

He always mentioned it as a crucible and a mean God has chosen to free us from the worldly debt and introduce us to American culture and a gateway to finding the gospel.

If greatness is defined as being true to one's responsibility, my father had it -- in abundance.

Recently, my mom, told me how proud he was of me.

He rarely expressed it in words, but I felt it growing up.\
Even now, I feel his love and guidance.

I love you too, Dad.
