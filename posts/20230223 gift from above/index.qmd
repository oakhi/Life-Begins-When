Received another round of gift from above -- moisture -- in the form of mixed precipitation or sleet.

## Magical Winter Scenes

Earlier in the month, wife asked,

> Are you getting tired of removing snow from the sidewalk?

I could have agreed with her, 
Instead I said,

> I enjoy shoveling snow.

Since each snowflakes are unique
Each storm brings, slightly different type of snow.
Each snow removing session is also unique and a strategy driven event.

Use the `shovel-and-throw-over-shoulder` approach or the `plow-until-you-can't-push`

It is magical how snow reaches the ground and covers everything.

- How are layers of snow deposited on surfaces?  
  - It it temperature driven?
  - Is there a industrial equivalence?
- Which factors determine rain, freezing rain and snow?

[Not only the scene but the sound changes after snow, things are more serene and quieter.]

## Decisions : Short vs Long Term

There are short term decisions. Where to dine, which country to visit, who to date.

Then there are longer term decisions. Which food to avoid and how much to intake, which neighborhood to set up home, who to commit to and live this life together.

The decision to live in Utah, with its long and snowy winter, was made decades ago.

Decided to take spring wild flowers, summer heat, fall foliage, as well as the winter storms.

(Thus gladly accepting inches of gift of moisture in a high desert),

Rather than judging a place by short visits, there are many who made decisions to make Utah their home.

As well as those that have decided that desert southwest will be their home - year round.

As my sister in Arizona says, 

> Arizona has summer months, and Utah has its winter months, as burdens to bear.

[But if one avoids the place, job, relationship because of limited exposure to extremes or based on rumors or writings on internet, then one misses out on the opportunity to see and experience the abundance of nature, a chance for an advancement and expanding and enriching friendship]

## Reflecting on removing snow

There was time when I wished for snow to plow -- lots of it.

Having a snow plow equipped, 4-wheeler meant, snow removal was something to look forward to.

Now days, if someone offered to clean my sidewalk, wonder how I would respond.

- how would I spend the time saved
- lose out on the opportunity to exercise

It is a great feeling to see the clean sidewalk, that would take less than 30 minutes to clear.

The warm weather is most effective means of snow removal.

One develops sense of when to pick up the shovel, or wait on benevolence of neighbors or nature.

As I grow older, hope that I have the strength and fortitude of this gentleman in Park City.
