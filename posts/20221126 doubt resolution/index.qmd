YouTube algorithm suggested Rabbi Manis Friedman.

The Rabbi looks like someone from the Old Testament days, with a long white beard.

So far I heard him talk about money, relationship and meaning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quoting Gemara (Talmud) he said in a video post,

"there's no joy like the joy of the resolution of doubts"

Because,

Things that make us unhappy are doubts.

Best solution to regaining joy is to

(wake up in the morning and)

focus on the things you have no doubts about

(and repeat at the end of the day)

my parents' life, that is something to remember.
