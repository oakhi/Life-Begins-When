There are advantages to being a non-summer visitors to summer destinations or mud season visitors to skiing resorts.

One has the entire place and time to contemplate.

The canyons near us are full of crowd

Couple dozen parking lots are full unless you arrive early

The regulars say the Covid pushed the visitors high.

But after Summer Time change, crowds are gone

Solitude and winter graces the scene

Reminiscent

Tao Yuen Ming summarized thus

Normally reserved Bishop B. was not his normal self.

As he opened the meeting, he announced a passing of a Ward Member.

Normally, this announcement would not be a surprise.

But this one, people were in disbelief.

How could someone so active and full of life pass away so suddenly.

The prior to bearing his testimony, he announced another member had died.

He testified of the Plan of Salvation and how difficult it was to announce passing of Ward Members,

Turns out, the Bishopric was notified at 11:58 and at 12:13.

Our church begins at Noon.

The testimony transformed into a tribute meeting for these members.

The one that died suddenly was in his mid 80s.

He joined outdoors and could be seen either hiking or riding his motorized bike up the Rock Canyon.

The second who was in her mid 90s was in declining health.

Back in February, after passing of my mother, her family held a delightful family gathering.

I was able to meet my colleague from decades ago, who was the member's younger brother.

Her family shared this message with the Ward, a few days later.

> Moving into this ward turned out to be a multitude of miracles for her; it is no exaggeration to say that you gave her another decade of joyous life through your kindness and sincere friendship.

This can be said of my parents who lived out their remaining days among fellow saints and of the household of saints.

They were reinvigorated by cool mountain air and put their energy into gardening, but mostly by the love and care of neighbors and professionals in the area.

## The Ward of my Youth

My father and his friends gathered to decide where they would immigrate to in the United States

After some discussion, someone suggested Washington DC area.

It may have been a random occurrence, that we moved to MD/DC/VA area.

But based on the experiences and people we met at the Carrollton Ward, it was not mere chance.

The church gave us an anchor and meaning and purpose to a young immigrant.

Church members that were older became surrogate mothers and fathers, uncles and aunts.

As it stated in Isaiah 49 v.22

> ...and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.

We were thus carried through difficult immigrant days..
