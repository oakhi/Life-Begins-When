[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture^[한국민족문화대백과사전, 韓国民族文化大百科辞典]](http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/) defines hometown or 고향(故鄕) as

> 태어나서 자라고 살아온 곳 또는 마음속 깊이 간직한 그립고 정든 장소.

or

> A place where you were born, raised and lived, or a place you miss and love deeply in your heart

My mother was born and raised at

황해도 장영군 후남면 남호리 291. 

Google search of her hometown yields  
**Google Maps can't find...**

My mother's family is originally from Pyong Yang (평양, 平壤) area.  

Her family went through occupation by Japanese and Russians.  
Learned about communism, firsthand.  
A war between Koreas, lost her father at age 14.   
Then escaped to South Korea.

All this before she turned 20 years old

## Life under the Japanese Occupation (1932-1945)

Mother's family owned land and buildings.   
They owned a local hub for merchandise called 협성상회協成商会.  
They also distributed Mainichi Daily 毎日新聞

Grandfather often traveled to Incheon to trade and would bring back latest merchandise home.

Life was not idyllic but they were well off for the time and place.

One day, grandfather took mom aside and showed their holdings and commented.

> "all this land belongs to us. orchard and rice fields, plus buildings"

Looking back, my mother observed. 
Life wasn't easy but no one starved, necessary items were plentiful, and even fish was visible in the stream.

## Life after liberation : Communism and Russian occupation (1945-1950)

Communists took everything, putting red stickers on all of mom's belongings.   
Former workers brought food for a year, until no one had private food.

There was no longer incentive to work harder.  
Everyone got same amount.  
(They would count grains to give same amount)

Mom had to gather woods, using an 'A' Frame, or [지게](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jige), she was 13 and the oldest.

She was trained to use guns and military drills - using Russian words and techniques.

Communists turned parents against children. 
By forcing children to report against parents and vice versa.

(Compare Malachi 4:6)

> And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse

## Separation of Hwang Family (1945-1950)

Our grandfather passed away in 1945, the same year that his only son was born. 
With death of the father, the life became increasingly difficult for the family.

Once asked mom how she survived bombings during the war. She responded simply,

> we had a bunker built next to the kitchen. when the air-raid siren sounded, we all took refuge in the bunker

With battle for the control of 38th Parallel continuing around the area, family elders arranged for an escape.

As mother left her home, the family hid the ancestral records underneath wood paneling that separated living area from the house foundation.

Many of the elderly stayed because because the evacuation was temporary

45 person boat was arranged however only half the boat was filled. (Mom's family almost didn't make it to the rendevouz point).

One lady had a baby on the boat. The family got extra rations, since there were 5 children with a single mother.

## A family member left behind

Additional tragedy, and one that hasn't been resolved to this day, was that one of the siblings didn't get on that boat.   
Originally, my mother was chosen to spend time with an aunt (grandma's sister) in Wonsan. 
(Husband of the aunt was killed in an industrial accident and she had become a minister in a church)

But grandma Kim objected and insisted that her oldest daughter stay with her. 
As a compromise, the second oldest went to stay with the aunt. 
However, the bombing of roads and bridges meant that she couldn't get back in time to join the family.

My aunt, `Hyunsook` 현숙, was left behind. 
And we don't know whether she is still living.  
The last contact was over 70 years ago.

> 아~~ 꽃필 때나 오시려느냐

> 아~~~~ 눈올 때나 오시려느냐

> 보따리 등에 메고 넘던 고개길

> 산새도 나와 함께 울고 넘었지

> 자유여 너를 위해 자유여 너를 위해

> 이 목숨을 바친다

Will you return when flowers bloom  
Or when snow covers fields  
Recall when we escaped with essentials on our back  
Even birds sang mournfully through mountain passages  
Freedom, I re-dedicate my life
