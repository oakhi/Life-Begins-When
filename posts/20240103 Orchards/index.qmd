His aunt Sister `M` was taking care her Mom.
Once she dreamt that her ancestors came and asked their work to be done at a temple.

Now that area is part of the Payson Temple complex.

After we were married, we would visit the same area to pick apples. ^[Sister K also remembers picking asparagus]
There were simply too many apples that needed to be harvested.

We were joined by a number of other young families that fall morning

For a newly married, still in college, family this was the best way to spend a Saturday morning.

Recently dreamt that I was visiting an orchard.

It seemed like someone that looked like my mother was working there.
She looked busy and happy.

After a while we were given a take home gift.

As we passed the checkout area, wondered if we should declare the gift.

We did and the checker gave another gift, like the first gift.

Dreams are one way to convey messages.
If we are prepared and alert.

Sister `M` received messages through a dream.

Her properties contributed to an edifice that connects this world to others.

Likewise, we should make time for inspiration and communication
