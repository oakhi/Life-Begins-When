They are to live forever. They are always full of energy and hope. They are superheroes that we can always count on.

They are our parents.

One of the challenges of this life is to see our heroes fade away.

Many in my parents' generation experienced wars, colonial occupation, famine, torn families, political and economic upheavals, street demonstrations that led to democratic reforms and eventual economic miracle.

In particular, my parents had to re-start their lives in 2 different countries -- as refugees and immigrants.

Once as refugees of a war, from their home in North Korea to South Korea in their teenage years.

Next as a searching for better economic outcome immigrant to United States in their 40s

I don't recall all the individual lessons of my parents.

I do remember their calm approach to life.

Because of their experiences with people, events, and challenges that they had to overcome, growing up, I never saw them panic.

They would analyze the situation, draw upon their collective experiences, then formulate a plan to deal with it.  

If the burden seemed too heavy, they called on the help from above.

Their, not so secret, arsenal was their faith in God.

Both of them lived their lives in accordance with this Christian principles,

***Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.***

As my wife and I are assuming the role of that generation.

We are not prepared for that role and are scared about the future.

However, these things give us hope

Strength and tender care and love our parents demonstrated.

A certain knowledge that God is with us.

Watching and associating with the people of this rising generation.

This generation that knows far more than we ever imagined at their age.

This generation that is not afraid to tackle tasks, considered too difficult in generations past.

Thank you Mom and Dad, we can count on this new generation of superheroes.
