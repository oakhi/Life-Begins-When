A visitor, a dinner guest once stated.

> You have retained the best traits of 2 cultures : both your home country and your new country.

He may have been practicing the time-honored tradition of thanking and praising the host.

But, in case he meant it, his comment triggers these follow up questions.

-   can their be a common trait for America?
-   how can you aggregate individual characteristics and traits and yet represent the 300 million plus population
-   if it exists, where can I find this summary of traits

Before days of Internet, I obtained a copy of an article that outlined the `Common Traits of the American People`

However, I have since misplaced that paper copy.

I asked the `chat-GPT`[^1] to list the characteristic or traits of the American People. (See @sec-american for additional context).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Sister K. married me, she expected me to represent and practice the American model of traits rather than the Korean model.

She guessed incorrectly

(See @sec-korean for additional context).

By the time we met, I had lived in the United States longer than in Korea

I spent secondary and high school years in the United States.

However, I had lived in a Korean household and was raised in the Korean traditions.

So even though I had ample time to learn and adjust to the American standards, in Sister K's eyes, I was not American enough.

However, when Koreans, including the dinner guest that made the comment, see me they think of me as someone that thinks and behaves like an American or someone in between Korean and American.

There are only 2 traits that overlap between Korea and American traits, namely, (strong) work ethic and patriotism/strong sense of national identity.

That means, to be correct, I have to learn and carry 16 traits that cover both cultures or countries.

That seems nearly impossible, or is it?

## Chameleons and Adapters

I have become good at assessing the social context, deriving social cues and acting accordingly.

If the gathering is mostly older Koreans, I know how to act, based on traits \# 2, 3, and 4 (see, @sec-korean).

Likewise, if the meeting is somewhat younger American neighbors, I would employ the following, \# 4, 6, and 7 (see, @sec-american)

-   Am I disingenuous when I do this?
-   Did my dinner guest judge me incorrectly?
-   Will I continue to live the life of ambivalence?

Feeling of being an outsider is something that I have learned to accept.

However, even when I return to the country of birth, the same feeling lingers.

-   What am I to do?
-   How do I begin to resolve this?
-   Does this even matter?

## Not this OR that, but this AND that

The answer may not be found in comparing and contrasting characteristics of this or any other countries

But in finding higher, time proven standards that transcends these seemingly different traits that help us identify and categorize people into different cultures.

Even though I have yet met a person that completely checks of all those characteristics or misses them completely.

## The People of God; universal or primary traits

One can learn a lot about the people by observing their public holidays and celebrations.

As well as the myths and legends surrounding their start as a country or people.

I imagine if there were written records records available for all the current cultures, there would be some overlapping tales.

> How is it described in Hebrew scriptures.
>
> What are their religious observances?
>
> What are their characteristics?[^2]

[^2]: see, Exodus Chapter 20

-   Be God fearing and worship Him.

-   Acknowledge, Seek Him and let others find Him.

-   Remember and keep the sabbath day holy

-   Honor thy father and thy mother

-   Do not kill

-   Do not commit adultery

-   Do not steal

-   Do not bear false witness

-   Do not covet thy neighbor's possession

In my limited travel, I have met these god fearing, neighbor loving people.

They do not need a badge that shows their allegiance. Neither do they need to put on their religion identifying wardrobe.

Their actions show what god they believe and are becoming.

So to the dinner guest that thanked me and gave me praise.

I hope to continue to pursue praiseworthy, or in words of Paul,[^3]

[^3]: Philippians 4:8-9

> ...if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things
