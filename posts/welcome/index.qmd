To remember the faith, experience and wisdom of my parents.

Grateful for a chance to celebrate and recall blessings, challenges and joys of this life and mercy and goodness of God.

For guiding my parents out of North Korea, establishing a temporary home in the Incheon (인천, 仁川) area.  
Then a move to Maryland and establishing a root, based on Faith in Jesus Christ.
