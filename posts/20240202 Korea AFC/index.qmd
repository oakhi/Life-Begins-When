Dad enjoyed and followed sports, especially if it was an international match involving the Korean National Football Team.

He would listen, watch, every chance he got, to the World Cup, Asia Cup, or even friendlies.

And he was also a tough critic.

Like most older persons, he felt those younger person could do better, far better.

Perhaps forgetting that the competition and the game has gotten more intense and evolved since he last participated.

Recently had a chance to participate, as my father did, and followed the 대한민국 축구 국가대표팀[^1] in action.

They were participating in Asian Football Confederation Cup, the 2023 AFC Asian Cup held in Qatar.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thought I had outgrown the period when my father followed the National Team of his birth.

By watching the game, for 90 minutes or 2 hours, dad was was able to forget that he was abroad and take part along with his fellow countrymen in cheering and criticizing the players.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The advancement of video recording and streaming has altered the game viewing.

One can get the gist of the match by viewing the 10 or 15 minutes of highlights.

However, the real highlight for the players, those participating in attendance or using technology should be the singing of the national anthem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A reason for these tournament is to decide who is best in a given match, on a given day, under the circumstances that fate or luck provides.

The more enduring purpose is to showcase the progress of a nation on an international stage, both as a sports nation and a society.

-   How well do players and fans demonstrate the values of a nation?
-   Do players and fans show control, are their emotions in check?
-   Do players, fans both seen and unseen, demonstrate respect and appreciation to the rules and ideals of a sport competition?

Based on what I have observed and my personal feelings, the nation of Korea should be proud of its team.

The Korea team knows itself, despite friendly and not so friendly critiques and their suggestions.

The Korea team also knows the competition

The members of its team has participated in highest levels of competition abroad.

They have demonstrated, that they belong on an international stage. For they not only surpassed the minimum requirements but are playing at an exceptionally high level in terms of ideals of a sport.

Building on that moral victory, by the players on the field of play and in the hearts of its cheering fans, the ultimate goal can be realized.

The ideal of representing a nation and lifting the spirit of its citizens via good sportsmanship - whether in victory or in defeat.
