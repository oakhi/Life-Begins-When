> Where are you from?

A simple question.

Yet, as an immigrant, 실향민(失鄕民)[^1] a son of a refugee, the answer can be complex and may vary from time to time and from person to person.

[^1]: 실향민(失鄕民)은 고향을 떠난 후 고향에 자유로이 돌아갈 길이 막힌 사람들이다, A person without a home or prevented from going home.

If the question is a conversation starter, I normally answer

-   I am originally from Korea
-   I grew up in Korea then moved to Washington DC area
-   I lived most (2/3) of my life in Utah.

This seems to satisfy most people.

If I sense that they have the time and the focus is what defines me, the origin of our family, then my answer becomes,

-   my parents are from North Korea but I was born and raised in South Korea, place near Incheon

A christian person, raised in two continents, by a Korean parents, who were a political and economic refugee.

It used to be no one really knew where Korea was so the topic of the conversation quickly shifted.

Now days however, it often surprises me to hear from people, that they have heard of and even experienced Korea and its culture.

-   K-Drama

-   K-Food

-   K-Pop

This year marks 50 years since we moved from Korea to the United States

I have experienced both cultures and some of religious observances of both nations.

I am familiar with and mostly comfortable with where I am from and where I am going in the day to day sense.

So I have various answers that answers the 1st Question.

However, if someone was to ask where are you from or where are you going after this life, in the spiritual or religious sense.

How would I answer that follow up or the 2nd Question.

> Quo Vadis?^[A movie with that same title was popular in Korea, made in 1951]

I have not visited the parts of old Korea that my parents grew up in.
They spent their early teenage years in areas north of 38 degrees latitude.
That dividing line that separates the country; both symbolically and politically.

Primarily affecting the people and families that used to be one.

I was raised on their stories of families struggling to survive, finding meaning through God and eventually thriving in a new country.

Furthermore, I have witnessed the hand of God as he guided and gathered our family.

Beginning in Korea from areas 안변^[https://maps.app.goo.gl/6QEH1Zw4FC4HQoCw8] (near 원산) and 강서^[https://maps.app.goo.gl/W4GWJgr262pirEm3A] (near 평양)

Then meeting, settling, and establishing in 인천, 부평 ^[https://maps.app.goo.gl/c4nEDn6nsXyNEJGUA] that was our Goshen and our Bountiful.
We were being established both financially and spiritually.

Financially, because Dad was employed overseas in Vietnam.
Spiritually, due to the efforts from missionaries from across the sea.

Settling and re-establishing ourselves in Maryland.
Nurtured by the saints in the Silver Spring Stake, Carrollton Ward.

Koreans have an expression, 돌아가시다. 
To return to that place of origin. 
It is used when someone passes away.

This underscores that we had a beginning, we came here to prove ourselves, as recorded in Abraham, in the Pearl of Great Price.

Then after our sojourn, we will return to that place of beginning that is our eternal home.

And to that Being that gave us life.

Intellectually, the answer to the 2nd Question is,

> I don't know for sure.

However, spiritually I know the answer.

> My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep.^[2 Nephi 4:20]

That same God led and protected my parents.
I am grateful to them and the knowledge they shared and lived.

That we do not become a 실향민 in the spiritual sense.
A person without a place to call or unable to return home 
Or a person who is prevented from returning home due to man-made circumstances.
