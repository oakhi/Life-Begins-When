Where are you from?

Simple question

Depending on how I feel and judging what they are looking for I say the following

-   from Washington DC are,a - where we first settled as a family in America

-   from Utah - where i lived for the vast majority of my life. (nearly 2/3)

-   originally from Korea - the place of my birth and home for the first decade of my life

If I sense that they have the time and the interest I say

-   my parents are from North Korea but I was born and raised in South Korea, place near Incheon
