> Where are you from?

A simple question.

Yet, as an immigrant, 실향민(失鄕民)[^1] a son of a refugee, the answer can be complex and may vary from time to time and from person to person.

[^1]: 실향민(失鄕民)은 고향을 떠난 후 고향에 자유로이 돌아갈 길이 막힌 사람들이다,

If the question is a conversation starter, I normally answer

-   I am originally from Korea
-   I grew up in Korea then moved to Washington DC area
-   I lived most (2/3) of my life in Utah.

This seems to satisfy most people.

If I sense that they have the time and the focus is what defines me, the origin of our family, then my answer becomes,

-   my parents are from North Korea but I was born and raised in South Korea, place near Incheon

A christian person, raised in two continents, by a Korean parents, who were a political and economic refugee.

It used to be no one really knew where Korea was so the topic of the conversation quickly shifted.

Now days however, it often surprises me to hear from people all of the world, that they have heard of and even experienced Korea and its culture.

-   K-Drama

-   K-Food

-   K-Pop

This year marks 50 years since we moved from Korea to the United States

I have experienced both cultures and some of religious observances of both nations.

I am familiar with where I am from and where I am going in the day to day sense.

However, if someone was to ask where are you from or where are you going after this life in the spiritual or religious sense how would I answer.

Koreans have an expression, 돌아가시다. 
To return to that place of origin.
It is used when someone passes away.

This underscores that we had a beginning, we came here to prove ourselves, as recorded in Abraham, in the Pearl of Great Price.

Then after our sojourn, we will return to that place of beginning that is our eternal home.

And to that Being that gave us life.

That we do not become a 실향민 in the spiritual sense
A person without a place to call or unable to return home
Or a person who is prevented from returning home due to man-made circumstances.
