Cell phones disguised as pocket cameras with a full DSLR capabilities

Miniaturized optics and ever optimized software

Was surprised to see a man carrying a ladder on his car.

Justified by his height, still didn't think it would make much difference.

Even few inches make a difference

As Ansel Adams said,

One takes photo by moving feet.

One cannot alter or rearrange nature but one can change one's relationship to it.

## Fiction vs Non-Fiction Photos

With persistence of photo altering where does it end?

A discussion with a young man at Park City gallery

It was a sunset shot of a well known location southeast of Page.

Told him, I had been there and the photo didn't represent the location

He said it did, implying that the photographer had his/her artistic license to enhance the shot.

To me, the background seemed borrowed,

The chances that location seeing that much of cloud, ready to drop summer thunderstorm amount seemed minimal.

Since then I have backed of the insistence that the photoshop irrevocably altered the image.

It no longer represented the locale.

Other than golden hour

each location has its moment in the sunlight.

It may take a while and doesn't last too long but there is that moment

It is the job of the photographer to calculate, be ready and pounce on it.
