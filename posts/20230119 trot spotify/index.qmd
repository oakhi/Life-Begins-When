Recently gave up my access to Spotify Premium

Earlier, my son offered to include me in his Spotify Premium Plan.  
I was excited to explore a new music source.  
Thought I would learn about dozens of new artists and listen to 100s of new songs.

That didn’t happen.

I ran out of memory  
Or more accurately,  
I no longer have memories that matches current songs

Realized that musical experience is not only an investment in learning songs and lyrics, as well as the artist, but also matching songs to one’s life’s memory

옛 사랑

남들도 모르게 서성이다 울었지  
지나온 일들이 가슴에 사무쳐  
텅빈 하늘 밑 불빛들 켜져가면  
옛사랑 그 이름 아껴 불러보네  
찬바람 불어와 옷깃을 여미우다  
후회가 또 화가 나 눈물이 흐르네  
누가 물어도 아플 것 같지 않던  
지나온 내 모습 모두 거짓인가

`Old Love`

Alone, wandered and cried.  
Past events that won't let go  
Open skies and man-made lights aglow  

Remember an old name and a face  
Cold wind makes me tighten coat collars  
Remembering the past makes me regret, angered  

Used to think looking back would be pain-free.  
Was that memory real?

## Music Listening Pattern

I mostly listen to songs from my parent’s generation up to the time when I was in my 20s. (1940s-1980s)

They are about topics I understand and the music I can follow along and sing.

Recently found out that what I listen to has a name, it is called `Trot` (as in Foxtrot),  Similar to Enka [演歌](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enka)

It is a well defined genre among Koreans,
According to Wikipedia, its 2 main themes are:

- love and parting, 
- longing for a home

## Trot Beginning

Recount the love, sorrow, separation in the past

## Trot Middle

The account from several angles, including regional legends.

## Trot Close

Hope for a closure or redemption.

## Transition to Modern K-Pop

In 1990 when I visited Korea after marriage.
My uncle commented, 

>“why is it that everyone is emphasizing dancing over singing…”

(I should have put my money on those talent agencies that cater to dancers.)

One element of Korean songs is a feeling of resentment; deep sorrow: A feeling of bitterness, deep resentment or sorrow that builds up in one's mind from an unfair or regretful event.

Didn’t fully realize these singers are singing more than just songs but a longing or yearning for a place, time, or a person they once met but no longer able to.

In essence, trot songs are K-Drama presented in a 5 minute segment.
Feelings, aspirations, and disappoints of each generation.

Within that longing lies a hope that one day will be realized.
Until then, my generation will sing those songs not found on Spotify.
