My father didn't express his feelings much.
Like most men from his generation, less words the better.

Was surprised to discover journals kept by him, in his 80s.

My father spent 36 years in Maryland area.
Then in summer of 2010, he sold his home and moved to Provo to be close to the grandchildren.

His life in Utah centered around the family and his God.

Daily activites were with the family and for the family.
When good things happened, big or small, he thanked the source of all blessings - our God

It has been said "a picture is worth thousand words"  
However the original quote refers to deed or action

- Henrik Ibsen

Then it is possible that a single act or deed can inspire a multitude of imagery or words.

There are multiple ways of living a record or legacy.

A visual medium such as video has multiple codec.  
A audio format has even more ways to encode data.

However, how many of these will survive and be interpreted by future generations.

The engraved or written record may be the most simple yet most enduring - precisely because of its simplicity.

While the world may search for the most accurate depiction of its surroundings and everyday occurrence, perhaps the most potent and effective means of preserving and passing on the values from one generation to another is used by the young and old alike -- writing down the feelings of each moment.

Because, it is not the amount nor the accuracy that ultimately matters, but the feelings that the message conveys, and the impressions or imagery the message conjures up.

Thanks dad for keeping the journal for us to remember your good life.

It reminds me to be industrious, do good, and give thanks, until the very end.
