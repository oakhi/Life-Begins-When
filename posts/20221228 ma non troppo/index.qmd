Life is kind, it washes away and lets us forget pains and troubles, little by little.

Life is cruel, it also extinguishes memories that you want to hold onto, all at once.

However, a small trigger, a kindness can ignite a flood of memories.

Each day I am more keenly aware of passage of time and an eventual end of present engagement or the assignment.


Hence the increased awareness and appreciation of each sunrise and sunset

Increased fondness for friendship and shared memories.


In daily, or hourly struggles,

Sometimes, I wish for a credit for lost weeks, months, and even years, because of things that can't be controlled.  
At times, I am glad that I can't recall, with any details those forgettable moments.

I am satisfied that God knows and is in charge and I must submit to my lot in life.

- Ecclesiastes 3:11

> ***He has made everything beautiful in its time.  He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.  NIV (New International Version)***
