Teachers that teach for living

Subject matter is known if not memorized Is there something new, that can come out of Nazareth or any other towns where few are gathered in the name of Christ?

Questions rather than answers

In the age of profileration of answers Refreshing to hear questions that refine what our purpose is

Bite his tongue and not give answers

In counseling people are not looking for answers from you. They are seeking to be heard And when 2 people hear and understand an issue The answer arises naturally and beautifully

Need motivation to get going or take action based on that prompting

The answer is yes
