Communication between two parties can yield varying results.

Because of differing experiences and readiness, the difference between the transmitted and intended message may vary greatly.

My sisters often talked to our mother on different subjects and with different approaches or angles. 
Thus they had a different understanding and recollection of the same event.

There are times we rely on oral recollections over written versions.

-   How do we resolve these differences.
-   How critical are these differences.

## Lessons from our parents

First we learn from parents by observing how they decide.
We learn about the outcome of their decision and action.

Then we formulate our own direction in life based on their examples.

In recent memorial for our mother, all 3 siblings prepared remarks. 
Not one of us delivered the prepared message.

(The order of delivery also affected what messages needed to be filtered, since it was covered by other speakers)

Instead we all delivered another version of the message that we felt was more appropriate.

Learned the following

-   prepare all you can beforehand
-   rely on the guidance from above
-   adjust the content and delivery to fit the promptings, the current audience and the latest situations.

This was the prepared message for Mom's Memorial.

My mother's life can be categorized into 3 areas.

- There is Beauty All Around
- Truth Shall Make You Free
- I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

## There is Beauty All Around

As a hymn suggests, we see the beauty all around us when we have love as a foundation.

She had a deep faith in Christ and we felt her love from the very early years in life.

Mother recognized beauty in all of God's creations she witnessed or the people came in contact with.\
She loved people and things as they were and what they could become. No detail was too small or insignificant to her.

She created beauty, even when the environment was chaotic or unorganized.\
We had a loving home with order and cleanliness.\
She knitted numerous creations, she could see a picture and create a sweater, a hat or warm piece for your neck. We are sure all of you have at least one of her latest creation, the dish scrubber(scouring pad) or [수세미](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%88%98%EC%84%B8%EB%AF%B8)

She could out produce any farmers, she and father would turn a patch of lawn into a plot of land any farmer would grade as A+

My sister and I were sent in search of wild onions or Dal Rae [달래](https://ko.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%8B%AC%EB%9E%98) We went to Rock Canyon and climbed up rocks and risked our lives and we found them She planted wild onions on her farm and we were able to taste wild onions.

Still can taste the lettuce that she grew in spring and into the summer. By wrapping around any food and putting the special sauce she created, the taste was something that we all would cherish.

We didn't dine out much when growing up. We thought it was because we were poor, and we were. But learned later on that our mom was well-known as a connoisseur and a creator of Northern Korean cuisine.

## Truth Shall Make You Free

Mother had a tremendous curiosity for all things, especially people.

Recently while organizing her things.\
We found a number journals and logbooks that she detailed, well into her 80s;

her study of the gospel as a Sunday School teacher Also she chronicled her love of cooking in a recipe book.

She sought for the foundational knowledge on all she encountered She didn't want to rely on others, she was independent thinker

She learned truth by study and from inspiration and she became free.

She took a special interest in all she met and especially the young and babies. She used to say, you know you have been around for a while when you can remember 3 generations that came before you and can see in person 3 generations that will carry on the legacy.

She would make that `special sound of joy` that only she can make whenever she met young people or babies.

She was able to think clearly and make quick and correct decisions. Amazed that she maintained this ability to the very end,

## I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

She believed in Christ. She lived as a follower of Christ. She lifted and reminded others that they are children of a Heavenly Father.

Not only did she make us feel loved and important but that we can accomplish anything.

When I was struggling in school and without direction and felt like quitting. She would tell me how she carried on even through the death of her father and the Korean War. She was telling me you can do this with faith in Christ.

Visited with our uncle, my father's youngest brother who is 13 years younger than my father. He mentioned how mom elevated his status as a human being. She insisted that he finish college when only 20% of the population had college degree Also the per capita income in Korea at that time was \$100 USD per person[^1].

Through means only she could have figured out, She encouraged my uncle and he was able to finish his studies and he is indebted to our mother as we are

She showed us by being a wonderful mother, a faithful wife, and loving Grandmother.

She endured and showed us how to live this life fully and we must follow in her footsteps.

In the name of Jesus Christ
