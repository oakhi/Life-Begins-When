## The beginning

At the beginning of marriage years, my cousin in Korea bought me a packet of 5 cassettes containing Korean Lyric songs.

Lyric Songs are made by combining a poem with a slowed dowm version of western music.

Each cassette contained about 22.5 to 25 minutes of music.

All music was good, in particular tape 4.
Made a copy of that tape.

## Clouds in Nature through Photography

Along with tracking sunrise and sunset times.
Knowing moonrise and moonset times and directions is helpful.

Less predictable but more impactful and more rewarding are the direction and amount of cloud coverage.

One starts looking for any signs of cloud coverage and formations.

And if it happens about the time of sunrise and sunset, it is a bonus.

## Clouds (Challenges and Trials) in Life

Lately asked Sister K

> Why is this life so difficult and full of challenges?

She replied.

> It always has been and always will be, you just have become more aware due to recent events around you.

Mentally and theoretically, it is easy to understand and justify that challenges and trials are part of this life.

Emotionally and spiritually, however, the amount and timing seems overwhelming and more than one can bear.

## That Place : Clouds Gather

That place where clouds drifts and flows
The longing will flow to it also

The place of a new birth and flowers blooming.
It is calling me home.

That place of happiness is the destiny of longing.

That place where clouds drifts and flows

The yearning of hearts burns with desire.
That place, of happiness, for eternal love is far
Over mountains and oceans.

That place where clouds drifts and flows
My heart and longings will follow

Till we meet, my love will flow and drift
To that place where clouds drift and flow.
