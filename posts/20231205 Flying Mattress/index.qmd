One quick way to find your influence or status in the family is to invite more people to your home than you have beds and bedrooms.

We had such occasion during a family wedding.

Some visitors chose to go the Airbnb route or a traditional hotel stay.

Some, however, chose the more established means -- staying with relatives.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Current Stock

That kicked off the planning.

Which visiting family gets which bedrooms and who gets to sleep on the floor versus beds.

I missed  both cuts and wound up sleeping on the floor with a mat.

The mat was about 30" by 72" (I measured since it looked kind of narrow).

The size of the mat and the material seemed familiar.

It was similar to a business class, lie flat, offerings for long distance flights.

Both in terms of construction material and the aforementioned dimensions.

Only missing items were the entertainment console with private reading lamp and attendant call button.

There was a time when I would look forward to long flights and sit/lie down on those beds in the sky.

My stock had fallen far and quickly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This time around, I was a few inches off the ground.

There was no need to worry about falling off.

I slept as well as I did on my regular bed.

Probably because, unlike those trips abroad. I didn't need the help of noise cancellation or had the distraction of dozens of movies on demand.

And in someways, sleeping on the floor is the traditional Korean way.  The way I was raised for the first 10 years

## Travel courtesy of corporations

Nearly all of my travels abroad and some within United States were made possible due to my employment.

Worked for a company that was expanding geographically and employed a full time travel coordinator on-site.

For a time, I was the leading traveler, earning some envious comments from my colleagues,

"stop draining our travel budge, leave some for us..."

The prevailing rule for long distance travel was if the travel was longer than 8 hours, everyone traveled in the Business Class.

The company was expecting me to best represent them and was kind enough to offer a nice accommodations to overcome the inevitable jet-lag.

That should not make me any more or less than who I am

## Perception of value

Like Ronins (浪人) of the past, when companies no longer expand, corporate travel warriors are no longer in demand.

Ones value may have changed or diminished.

Or just the focus of the organization is no longer geographic expansion.

Flew Business Class, for the first time, when I was 34.

With that, felt like I was promoted to a several level higher and I acted accordingly.

Sometimes not it a positive manner.

Those traveling days are behind me.

Now I am spending more time with the family.

What am I judged on?

Practical skills like cooking, cleaning, and tending to kids.

Much greater responsibility, less recognition and far less reward -- as far as things of this world's measurement

## Rewarded according to the skills in demand.

Family may not demand certain skills or services right away. And in some cases, when one is not around, they will seek that service elsewhere

But you are evaluated constantly

In the end, individuals that comprises the family are far more critical.

They do not give out grades or salaries

Something far more fair and equitable.

They become what you spend time doing and building

I understand my role better.

I am willing take that mat on the floor at home over any fancy accommodations at a ground level or 37,000 feet in the air.
