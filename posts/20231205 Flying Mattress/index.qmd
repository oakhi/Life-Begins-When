One quick way to find your influence or status in the family is to invite more people to your home than you have beds and bedrooms.

We had such occasion during a wedding.

Some visitors chose to go the Airbnb route or a traditional hotel stay.

Some, however, chose the more established means -- staying with relatives.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

That kicked off the planning.

Which visiting family gets which bedrooms and who gets to sleep on the floor versus beds.

Well, I missed the cut on both and wound up sleeping on the floor with a mat.

The mat was about 30" by 72" (I measured since it looked kind of narrow).

Then I got thinking, the size of the mat and the material seemed familiar.

It was similar to a business class, lie flat, offerings for long distance flights. Both in terms of construction material and the aforementioned dimensions.

All it was missing were the entertainment console with private reading lamp and attendant call button.

There was a time when I would look forward to long flights and sit/lie down on those beds in the sky.

How much has my stock fallen.

Approximately \$100/hour for the privilege of flying the business class. It did move 500\~600 miles per hour, at a cruising altitude of 37,000 feet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This time around, I was a few inches off the ground. 

There was no need to worry about falling off. 

I slept as well as I did on my regular bed.

Probably because, unlike those trips abroad. I didn't need the help of noise cancellation or had the distraction of dozens of movies on demand.

And in someways, sleeping on the floor is the traditional Korean way.

## Travel courtesy of corporations

Nearly all of my travels abroad and some within United States were made possible due to my employment.

Worked for a company that was expanding geographically and emploed a full time travel coordinator on-site.

For a time, I was the leading traveler, earning some envious comments from my colleagues,

"stop draining our travel budge, leave some for us..."

The prevailing rule for long distance travel was if the travel was longer than 8 hours, everyone traveled in the Business Class.

During one 12 month period, making 10 trans Pacific crossing vaulted my status to jump from a member to the elite member status.

Now that my corporate sponsored travel days are behind, I do miss those nearly carefree and worryfree travel days.

I do wish I had been less entitled traveler.

After traveling in certain way, dining and staying in certain level of restuarants and hotels, I became demanding type.

The company was expecting me to best represent them and was kind enough to offer a nice accomodations to overcome the ineviatble jet-lag.

That should not make me any more or less

Now days I had to renew my passport with my own money.

Had to relearn the steps of sending in the passport for a renewal.

Before, a travel broker took care of that.

With the renewal of passport

Thought of using my ever dwindling stash of mileage to travel

The prices have skyrocketed.

It was possible to travel to Tokyo (leisure price) for less than the travel to Houston (walk-up price for business travel).

## Perception of value

Like ronins of the past, when companies no longer expand, corporate travel warriors are no longer in demand.

Ones value has changed or diminished it is just that focus is elsewhere.

Flew Business Class, for the first time, when I was 34.

The company policy was for any business trip over 8 hour duration was automatically upgraded to a Business Class.

Felt like I was promoted to a manager level.

\

Problem was, I expected to be treated like I was somehow a VIP.

\

In 1997, I was working on a transfer of equipment from Sandy, Utah to Suzhou, Jiangsu.

\

A Chinese-Cambodian colleague working at Suzhou suggested we travel to Hangzhou during one weekend.

\

Then I saw a person standing outside of his home right next to the rails that comprise Shanghai Railroad Station.

\

Lessons from my own grandmothers.

My maternal grandmother became a widow in her early 30s with 5 daughters and a newly born son.

My paternal grandmother became a widow during the war with 4 sons and a daughter.

\

To be present where I am expected to be present - both time and place.

## Warmed Stones and Floors

In olden days, before central heating and cooling, homes in Korea were heated by circulating the warm air generated by the stove used for cooking.

In those days, the fuel was wood.

Then coal was used in its place.

The convenience of coal was matched by the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning.

The circulating heat was sent underneath the floor of the home, similar to water or coolant circulating a refrigerator.

The main difference was the heating of the floor was somewhat inefficient and after the fire had burned itself out, only a small area near the stove was kept warm.

In cold months, whole family would sleep with their toes facing the warm area.
