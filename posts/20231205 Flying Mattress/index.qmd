One quick way to find your influence or status in the family is to invite more people to your home than you have beds and bedrooms.

We had such occasion during a wedding.

Some visitors chose to go the Air BnB route or a traditional hotel stay.

Some, however, chose the more traditional way -- staying with relatives.

---

That kicked off the planning.

Which visiting family gets which bedrooms and who gets to sleep on the floor versus beds.

Well, I missed the cut on both and wound up sleeping on the floor with a mat.

The mat was about 30" by 72" (I measured since it looked kind of narrow).

Then I got thinking, the size of the mat and the material seemed familiar.

Yes, it was similar to a business, lie flat, offerings for long distance flights.

There was a time when I would look forward to long flights and sit/lie down on those beds in the sky.

How much has my stock fallen.

Approximately $100/hour for the privilege of flying the business class.  It did move 500~600 miles per hour, at a cruising altitude of 37,000 feet.

This time around, I was a few inches off the ground. 

There was no need to worry about falling off. 

I slept as well as I did on my regular bed.

Probably because, unlike those trips abroad. I didn't need the help of noise cancellation or had the distraction of dozens of movies on demand.

And in someways, sleeping on the floor is the traditional Korean way.

## Warmed Stones and Floors

In olden days, before central heating and cooling, homes in Korea were heated by circulating the warm air generated by the stove used for cooking.

In those days, the fuel was wood.

Then coal was used in its place.

The convenience of coal was matched by the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning.

The circulating heat was sent underneath the floor of the home, similar to water or coolant circulating a refrigerator.

The main difference was the heating of the floor was somewhat inefficient and after the fire had burned itself out, only a small area near the stove was kept warm.

In cold months, whole family would sleep with their toes facing the warm area.
