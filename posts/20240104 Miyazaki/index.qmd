Seldom talk about recent movies since I rarely watch new movies.  
Either streamed nor in theaters.

Last set of movies that I watched and discussed with others were the `Lord of the Rings` series

Since then, few times that I watched the new releases were either paid for by the company as a year-end `thank you` or for winning a contest.

Then a recommendation was given.
That we watch a Animation movie

Was surprised there was a new movie since I thought the director had retired.

## Theme of parent vs child relationship

Got lost in the plot

Whether it was a flashback or in real time
Whether animals were representing themselves or as humans

Watching Miyazaki film is a continuation since characters look similar and the story lines are equally hard to follow

This one was no exception

Then another movie was recommended
This one had a familiar title.

Was reluctant to see another movie within the same week.
Besides, it was a monster action movie.
I expected another Marvel/Star Wars Universe type of production.

I was pleasantly mistaken

It has story line and had relatable characters.

Subtitles helped but the setting and the acting conveyed more than the actual words.

The neighborhood transformation from a trash area to a inhabitable place paralleled the development and growth of characters.

Grateful that there are studios that still keep the art of movie making alive.

That good story can overcome, languages, traditions, and customs.



Thank you directors 宮崎 and 山崎 and respective studios for these gifts.
