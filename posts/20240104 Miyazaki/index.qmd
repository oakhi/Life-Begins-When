Seldom talk about recent movies since I rarely watch new movies.  Either streamed nor in theaters.

Last set of movies that I watched and discussed others were the Lord of the Rings series

Since then times that I watched the new releases were either paid for by the company as a year-end `thank you` or for winning a contest.

Then I was recommended that we watch a Animation movie

Was surprised there was a new movie since I thought the director had retired.

Theme of parent vs child relationship

Got lost in the plot

Whether it was a flashback or in real time
Whether animals were representing themselves or as humans

Watching Miyazakis film is a continuation since characters look siimilar and the story lines are hard to follow

This one was no exception

When another movie was recommmended

Was reluctant to see another movie within the same week.
Also it was a monster action movie.
I expected another Marvel/Star Wars Universe type of production.

I was pleasantly mistaken

It has storyline and had relatable characters.

Subtitles helped but the setting and the acting told more than the actual words.
