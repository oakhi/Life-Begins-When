There is a national dish almost all Koreans recognize.

A dish during lean years

Not particularly Korean nor Chinese in origin.

First bite brings back memories of those when food was scarce and money was rarely spent on dining out.

Before Korean food was available in SLC/Provo Area, we went south

At times to Las Vegas, but our main destination was LA.

Similar to main competition for Amusement Parks in Utah are in Southern Cal.

It helped that we had a family member in LA that knew the latest trends

It was there that we first experienced K-BBQ LA Style nearly 10 years ago

So it is not necessarily that food is good but it brings back memories

Now the next generation is also participating.

## An extension of the Day's Market Rule

It is said that, one always meet someone when you shop at local grocery store.

Similarly, one always meet at least one person that you know, at Hong Kong
