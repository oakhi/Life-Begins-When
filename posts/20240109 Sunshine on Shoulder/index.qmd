Dad loved to be outside, year around.

But especially during winter, when the angle of the sun penetrated the sitting area.

Ours was a south-facing home with a porch

The sun reaches the porch at the right angle

During winter months, it is possible to not see a sun during a short day.

Hope of spring with the Solar-based New Year, followed by a Lunar-based New Year.

Finally a Spring Solstice.

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy\
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry\
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely\
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you\
I'd give to you a day just like today\
If I had a song that I could sing for you\
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy\
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry\
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely\
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a tale that I could tell you\
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile\
If I had a wish that I could wish for you\
I'd make a wish for sunshine all the while

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy\
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry\
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely\
Sunshine almost always makes me high\
Sunshine almost all the time makes me high\
Sunshine almost always
