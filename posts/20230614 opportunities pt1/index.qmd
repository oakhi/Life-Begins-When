Was ending my 4 year ExPat assignment
I had completed my role and was coming back to US.
The manager told me

> Don’t go looking for opportunities they will come looking for you

Unfortunately, things didn’t happen as he predicted.
I had to look for and apply for opportunities since those words were spoken 20 years ago.

However, I think I understand the intent of his message.

- You have done something significant for you and the company, and we appreciate it.
- You have skills that are well suited for this and similar roles.

## Multiple perspectives on opportunities

Early in my career, first 5 or 6 years, I was bound to my office.
Never attended a seminar or a conference in other locations.

Then in 1997, a colleague invited me to travel to Suzhou.
We were to transfer a set of equipment that enabled them to make catheters.

For the next years, I would travel extensively, achieving the top-tier in bonus points with United.
Also the company asked me to live abroad and help with acquistion and transition of Korean Medical Device companies.

The arrangement was mutually beneficial.
I was providing a service that very few individuals can, a knowledge of local language and culture plus the knowledge of specific set of catheter manufacturing knowledge.

At some point, I made a mistake of thinking that the company existed to serve my needs.
It is the other way around.

## Opportunities Redefined

> Was the manager incorrect in saying that opportunities will come?

Similar to company/individual relationship and opportunities, Rabbi Manis Friedman provides another perspective.

To paraphrase,

> We do not have needs, God does.  
> He will use us, rather, we will partner with God  
> To achieve the purpose of our creation

Since the pronouncement of that manager, there has been a number of opportunities.
Including a work with a team in Japan for 6 years.
  
- How should I view/accept my recent role, working with the Japanese team?  
- Was it to fulfill my needs or did I partner with God in any degree?
- How many opportunities were lost, not even considered, because I was inward focused?

So the opportunity, as we see and define it, may not come along.  
However, other forms or represenations that are in effect opportunities will be available.

Therefore, we need to educated ourselves and make ourselves availble for that role.
