손자/孫子

I heard you said something back in Winter of 2021/22, during the Covid-19^[Corona Virus Disease 2019] Pandemic, something to the effect that you no longer had fears about the future.

Older Me

That sounds plausible, that was when I was serving with Young Adults in Provo.

I did say a few things that I didn’t document, or that I should not have said in the first place. 

But those words seem like something I could have said. 

Who told you I said those words?

손자/孫子

Professors Emily and Spencer at UCLA Medical School. 

Dr. Emily is head of the Neuroscience and AI Development and 

Dr. Spencer is an endowed professor of Research Institute for the Robotic Surgery. 

They both remembered and attributed those quotes as coming from you.

So do you remember them and why you made that statement?

Older Me

I remember Emily and Spencer well… 

I think we were heading into the 2nd or 3rd variant of the Covid-19 virus, and another spike in positive cases. 

Was concerned about the emotional and spiritual well-being of young people. 

In addition, I was worried about my future after retirement and the health of those around me, especially your great-grandma Hwang.

손자/孫子

I am glad you remembered them. 

So what was the genesis of change in thinking from negative to positive outlook?

Older Me

I began to think about the one-sided, usually negative, depressing scenario propagated through mediums we had at the time.

Something was didn't seem right and at times felt anxious about the future.

I thought there must be some positives that can be reported.

I need a change in perspective.

What would my mom and dad have done in a similar situation?

They endured immediate threat to life and impending hardships as refugees, due to being displaced from their homes and being drafted into combat duty.

They both knew the enemy, communist ideology and post-war poverty and they were able to endure, battle and overcome both.

손자/孫子

You mean the Covid-19 situation and predicted outcome was based on probable or model based.

Older Me

Exactly.

The prospective doom scenario was scary but at times they were off on their estimation. 

Sometimes, they were wrong.

In the case of Covid-19, we knew the enemy but it was shifting and self-replicating and therefore prognostications and diagnosis were ever changing, and sometimes incorrect.

I recall people were locked into battles of opinions, precedents, rights and fears, during this time of uncertainty -- relying on the strength of men and women and societal systems.

I, along with your grandma, clung to God of Old Testament and of New Testament for strength and comfort.

손자/孫子

So it was a combination of examples and life of your parents and remembering the God of Old and New Testament days. 

What was the result of having that thought and resolution? 
What did you do differently?

Older Me

Realized I had to be stronger spiritually, emotionally and physically to overcome the Pandemic or any other calamities .

Others can offer advice and even offer medical, man-made solutions, but I realized I need to be prepared for not only this Pandemic but all the other ones that were foretold.

Equally, I needed to rely, more fully, on the God of Miracles, the same God that led children of Israel from Egypt to the Land of Canaan.

Please remember that same spirit of resilience and reliance on the Lord that your forefathers had is also in you and your generation.

You can do this and other great, wondrous things that Lord God will ask you to perform

손자/孫子

You became both independent and dependent. 

The call to leave spiritual and physical Babylon is always with us. 

But at times, we need to endure likes of Pandemic.

Thanks Grandpa, that was very helpful. 

Any words for Professors Emily and Spencer, next time I am in their classes?

Older Me
