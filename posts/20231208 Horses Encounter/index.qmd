I have never owned horses but
I have known people that loved horses

A colleague from Japan, who studied in Warwick came to visit US.

After a number of visits to Shizuoka.
It was their turn to visit US.

What did they want to do.
Shoot, Shop and Ride a Mustang

First 2 were easy, but ride a horse.

The lady in the Payroll said, we own Mustangs
A program of domesticating and selling them.

She also arranged a ride up Butterfield Canyon
Indoor Riding.

People from Japan could not fathom
Neither could I

## Friends of Horses

During my college days, a friend asked me to accompany her to the Ellsworth Building.

Didn't know what the purpose of the building before the visit.

I was scared to ride, the height of horses far greater than I had imagined or seen in movies

She guided me through the process and made it seem like riding a bicycle, a tall one at that.

I survived

That was in the 1980s.

Fast forward 30 years and I am a project coordinator working with a manufacturer of medical device in Fukuroi, Japan.

My counterpart, K-San, is an avid horse rider.
She owns a horse, Taishan, that she keeps in nearby stable
