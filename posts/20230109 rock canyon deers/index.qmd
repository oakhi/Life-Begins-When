At first significant snowstorm, each fall, my dad would look towards Timpanogos and ask,

> “Wonder where deers go for their food…”

Since I didn’t know, I couldn’t answer so we moved on to a different topic.

Our family lived in Provo for nearly 40 years.

We have hiked Rock Canyon as a family.  
All of my children graduated from Rock Canyon Elementary.  

This is our neighborhood and we know all there is to know about it.

That was an incorrect reasoning.

One afternoon, after parking the car at the Rock Canyon Park, I started a hike up to the Bonneville Shoreline Trail.

Noticed a truck with a scope pointed at a spot above the trail.
My curiosity was piqued.

I didn’t have to ask much, the man anticipated my queries and explained in detail about the feeding pattern, places to watch, best times to see.  

He knew so much about the deer herd of Rock Canyon.
He showed me when to look (during mealtime), where to look (30-40 feet above the trail), and what to look for (herd of deer).

I had never seen a deer herd before meeting this man with a scope.  
Since meeting with and coaching from the man, I can’t avoid seeing the herd.

One day, during a snowstorm, I saw a group of deer, moving together on a well-defined path, along the south edge of the Squaw Peak, about 200 feet above where I was.

So what seemed like a rhetorical question by my dad, turned into a specific teaching moment for me about the survival of deer in the wintertime.

(Perhaps my dad, who has passed away, was gently influencing the man with the scope to teach me a thing or two)

So in this life, it seems, that one can pose a question or raise an issue and others may solve it for us.
Or one can jump in and try to find, not only the answer, but also implement the solution once found.

and he that seeketh findeth; 
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
