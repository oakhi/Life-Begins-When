I live close to a location with both a nondescript and a pedestrian name.

That aptly named place was accessible for nearly 40 years.

During those years, it was like a National Park hours away, for I visited it once a year or less.

I rediscovered it recently.

For most of those years, I was commuting to Salt Lake Valley - over a 30-mile commute.

A change in job to a Utah Valley location meant the commuting time spent in cars or trains/buses can be replaced by a number of activities.

I followed a suggestion on a website^[https://www.rockcanyonutah.com/].

> The canyon...draws thousands of people annually who seek recreation, renewal, and inspiration. 
> It is one of the few remaining "URBAN FORESTS" in the United States

A few times that I hiked the area, I was not impressed.

Aside from a few geological features, the trail was unremarkable.

I usually went after the sun had risen, during the summer months.

Afterwards, I concluded that an hour or two spent in the canyon or the forest was not worth it.

Then I switched the hiking hours so that I could visit the area in the morning and still be at work

That meant an adjustment to the sleeping schedule.

The early morning hours highlighted peaks, fauna, and flora that I hadn't noticed before.

As I began to notice the small changes in the surroundings, I began to track and follow not only the sunrise and sunset information but also the moonrise and moonset data.

It was almost like being transported to a different location in a time capsule -- and back invigorated.

Those trips offered visual and aural as well as tactile experiences

The time spent in that capsule filtered and cleared my thoughts.  
It allowed me to forget things I should not hold onto.  
Lightened my mind and my burden.

I have experienced some of the more established, crowd-inviting locations with more exotic offerings.

But it was very difficult to experience its unique offerings during the peak visiting hours with all the other guests.

I have to agree with Mark, Mark Twain.

I didn't realize I lived next door to a National Park named Rock Canyon.

>When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years.
