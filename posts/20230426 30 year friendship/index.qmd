A friend lives in a town, 20 miles away. 
Situated nearly the height of Willis (Sears) Tower, above the valley.

He has lived there for nearly 30 years and we have known one another for nearly entire time.

Still remember when he announced he had sold his home near BYU (Brigham Young University). 

Can't remember much of subjects that were taught. 
But we became friends, as well as our wives and children got acquainted.

Over the years, we had a chance to visit their home in the mountains.  
Marveled how they improved both the land and their home.

Witnessed how they raised their children and at the same time taking care of their aging parents.  
Saw they were cared for with love.
The arrangement afforded both living independently and be among their grandchildren.
This was a life’s lesson to be cherished.  

Recall times when they would ‘camp’ out to get a great spot for the annual July 4th Parade.  
We would show up the morning of the Parade and they took us in.  
Consequently, extended family members were able to see the Parade in comfort and up close

Also we took long road trips together.  
(nearly all road trips are long in the West)  

Through Las Vegas as well as Cedar Breaks, at times.  
And making them even longer by going through seldom visited towns such as Alamo and Caliente, Nevada.

In Alamo, we visited Mr. and Mrs. Martin Cox who used to live near us.

Once, they invited our whole family, including my parents and my mother-in-law to [Fort Bridger Rendezvous](https://fortbridgerrendezvous.net/)

We were treated to meals, scenes, and experiences that we could not have on our own.

Thank you Pat and Mike and the rest of the Reid Clan for sharing part of your life with our family.  
We appreciate it very much.
