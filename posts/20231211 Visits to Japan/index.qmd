First visit in 2000 to Komatsu and Kanazawa and Fujinomiya

Surprised that a colleague from Tokyo office came to meet us and guide us

Didn't fully appreciate it

## Personal visit in 2007




## Company provided visit 2012 to 2016

Host had rented a van to take us to Fujinomiya
The pines by the seashore, no Fuji

On the way back, stopped at a rest stop.

There it opened up.

A view of mountain with the modern bridge and transporation.

Timeless couple
Man was either focused on the mountain or distracted 
Not focusing on the greatest assest sitting next to him

The person you are with is not only the most important person

That person is trying and will become God.
