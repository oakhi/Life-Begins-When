First visit in 2000 to Komatsu and Kanazawa and Fujinomiya

Surprised that a colleague from Tokyo office came to meet us and guide us

Didn't fully appreciate it

\"Customer is the King\" is a familiar phrase.

Yet it wasn\'t until I worked with a team from Shizuoka Japan, I learn the term,

\"Customer is God\"

 

Each organization develops a set of practices that not only guides and develops employees but also shapes company culture.

 

During the recent, 6-Year Technology Transfer project, the focus, from the US Team was understanding and learning the Explicit Knowledge, as captured in procedures and test methods. 

 

However, the Japan Team wanted to teach about the Tacit Knowledge.  That knowledge that is hard to capture in traditional means, a tribal knowledge. 

 

The Japan Team estimated training to be in units of months, whereas the US Team decided the training should be in units of weeks.

 

I have learned to see both sides of the fence as a Project Lead and determine the best course of action that benefits both sides.

 

Look forward to learning more details on how I can work with the Honda Team as an Autoliv OTC representative.

 

Thank you,

## Personal visit in 2007

## Company provided visit 2012 to 2016

Host had rented a van to take us to Fujinomiya The pines by the seashore, no Fuji

On the way back, stopped at a rest stop.

There it opened up.

A view of mountain with the modern bridge and transporation.

Timeless couple Man was either focused on the mountain or distracted Not focusing on the greatest assest sitting next to him

The person you are with is not only the most important person

That person is trying and will become God.
