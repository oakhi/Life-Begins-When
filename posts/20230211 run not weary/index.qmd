My parents were vibrant in their 70s, and active into their mid 80s.
They maintained their independence and the curse of dementia was kept at bay until the very last.

Tried to understand what was their source of vitality.

I didn't see either grandfathers so I don't know if the genetics played a role.
However, the grandmother on my father's side lived to be 92 and maternal grandmother lived to be 87.

Two traits that helped them live a full and healthy life were their sense of gratitude and their outlook on life.

My parents did not seek adventure nor fortune.

They did live through colonial occupation, transition to communism, and the survival during a war that took 2-3 million civilian lives^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War]

Having lived to some of the horrors and trials brought on by man-made conflicts, very few things could rattle them -- including poverty, hunger, or sickness.

They were happy that they lived through aerial bombings, escape via fishing boat, participation in major battles, survive 3 POW episodes.

Afterwards they could look back and thank the higher power or in their case, the Christian God.

In the end they accomplished both adventure and fortune.
