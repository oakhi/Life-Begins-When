Thought Nurse Beth had just reported to work.  
Turns out she was finishing up her 12-hour shift and was headed home.

She still had enough energy to fuel or recharge at least 2 persons.  
And with that energy, she radiated love for not only the patient but for all in the room.

> Can that level of warmth be obtained through training?

She lifted others by listening to and complementing afterwards those in the room.

Although I was a visitor that day, I had been lifted.
Specifically, given immunity to and healed from any illnesses that I may have had or will come in contact with.

There are certain modern phrases that are initially shunned, then accepted and eventually fully embraced.

One such phrase is `assisted living`.

Initially, the word and the concept behind it, is alien and is only applicable to others. 

Because it seems like contradictory terms. 
You are either living or are assisted, but not at the same time.

3 things helped me accept and embrace it.

## `Tuesdays with Morrie`

During my traveling days, one of the hotel chains had a free book campaign.
Take a book, read it, return it, if you are in the neighborhood.

I grabbed a copy of a book.

Some memorable lines,

> The culture we have doesn't make people feel good about themselves.
We are teaching the wrong things.
You have to be strong enough to say, if the culture doesn't work, don't use it.
Create your own culture.

Which side wins?

> Love wins, love always wins

The stroy made me re-evaluate my career-centric ways.
Coincidentally, I headed back home, from the expat assignment, within 2 years of reading that book.

## A Co-worker with ALS

Kristy was diagnosed with ALS^[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]. She was assisted by Cassie.

Kristy was head of the Payroll Group, Cassie was her assistant.
I had my cubicle outside of their office.

I never suspected Kristy was ill, because she was always cheerful.

Never forget that Halloween when Kristy chose to wear a home-made NY Yankees jersey. It was Lou Gehrig's uniform.

We became closer as we shared notes and talked about our sons on a mission.
Her's was to California, mine to Japan.

Recall the ice bucket challenge hosted by the R&D Group.  Its group leader also battle ALS.

Later on Cassie had to help Kristy.
More than office duties.

Even though Kristy could have stayed home, she still came to work a few times a week.

5 years ago this month, Kristy passed away at age 53.

(Years later, Kristy's daughter and Cassie's son married each other)

## Watching parents experience assisted living with dignity

During my early years, I was shielded from pain and suffering.
Also death in the family, since we moved and were far from the family.

Experienced death of near ones much later in life.

They did not have exposure or influenced many, but they did share one common attribute.

Tey all bore their sufferings with dignity.

They lived a full life.

And perhaps because there were loved ones, sustaining and comforting on both sides -- life and death.

They chose living, even if it meant assisted living. 

For they endured war and associated hunger, and starting a life with virtually nothing.

They also overcame arthritis, dialysis and other age related illness.

> "But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer."   
> â€• Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

It is easier to think that assisted living applies 2 extremes of our lives.
When we are born till we are independent.
And when we stop being independent to when we die

Then we realize that it is always assisted living. 
We are never fully alone, assisted by both seen and unseen.

Always feeling the presence of help nearby.

It is our task to be more like Morrie the Professor.
As he stated,

To give to the world what we possess.

Be present and lift others as Nurse Beth
