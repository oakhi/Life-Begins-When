When I visit Phoenix area, I tune into KBAQ, 89.5 FM

Soothing sounds and voices

Much like the ones I am used to in metropolitan Washington DC area.

If one had a strong FM receiver, one could listen to stations from 2 states, Maryland and Virginia as well as Washington DC.

We had a number of FM radio stations

Each universities had a station

American University - WAMU 88.5

Howard University - WHUR 96.3

Johns Hopkins University -

Also WKYS and the progressive station WHFS

For news it was WTOP-AM

WWDC 101.1 had Howard Stern show

But my favorite was listening to Marilyn Cooley at WETA 90.9 FM

103.5 WGMS was classical but transitioned to WTOP FM

Washington's Good Music Station

It was a treat to ears and helped me understand the language better.
