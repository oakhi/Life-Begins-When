2 things reminder

The term digital nomad and living out of suitcase

Had to look it up the term and remember when I moved around as a missionary and practically living out of a suitcase or 2.

An online dictionary definition,

> a person who earns a living working online in various locations of their choosing (rather than a fixed business location).


Living out of suitcase

Bellflower, Mariposa, Melrose, and Country Club.
Street names of some of the places in California.

Far longer as nomads or refugees.
Both seeking a better place for the household.

What is our destination
What are characteristics of Shangri La
When will we know when we arrived.

Mom always made a place a home,

The same on-line dictionary defines nomad as

> a member of a people having no permanent abode, and who travel from place to place to find fresh pasture for their livestock.

and refugee

> a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war, persecution, or natural disaster.

Then I must be a part of that nomad and a refugee

Are we not all beggars?

16 And also, ye yourselves will asuccor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the bbeggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.

17 Perhaps thou shalt asay: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are justâ€”

18 But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.

19 For behold, are we not all abeggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?
