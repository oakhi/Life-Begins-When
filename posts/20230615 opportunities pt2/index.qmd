> We wanted a Japanese person for the role   
> We would have accepted an American project leader  
> But a Korean person that doesn't drink!?!

Thus began my 6 year assignment to coordinate a production line transfer from Fukuroi(袋井市), Japan to Utah and Texas.

Wondered,

What happened to the description of Japanese people that I had studied prior to the visit.

> Japanese people are polite, shy, kind and most of the time indirect in communications.

This was not the beginning I had imagined.

After an 12 hour flights to arrive at Narita(成田市), we were on the way to Tokyo via Narita Express (NEX).

With that declaration, he single-handedly shook my confidence as well as stirred national differences that I had not considered.

[For this role, I had been interviewed by a Director of R&D, the VP of R&D, and the President of Technology.
They agreed that I could do this.
I wanted this role and believed that this was an opportunity that my previous manager predicted.]

Was ready to go home if there was a convenient way and if my Director and the VP hadn't accompanied me

However, relying on past human relationship lessons, I patiently listened to `H san`'s lecture on Japanese business practices for foreigners...

> Japan as a nation is a tight group. One mistake and you are branded.

I was glad that the ride was less than an hour.

## Start of the Project

Next morning, `H san` looked and acted differently than the night before.  Calm and far less words were conveyed.

I was to meet with the team I was to work with.
I wasn't as concerned about the technical aspect of the transfer.
Since I had worked in the industry over 15 years.

I had been chosen for the role, because I knew the Asian culture, not because of the language skills, unlike my role in Korea.
However, the main concern of the project, communicating with my counterpart vanished when I met `K san`.

`K san` had graduated from University of Warwick and had studied British Humor.

## A Social Lubricant

I had left Korea before I became a teenager.

I returned 25 years later. 
Many things had changed. 
But not the pervasive use of alcohol.

One manager described alcohol as a social lubricant.  
I saw it as neither social nor a lubricant.

It may seem to relax people that drink.
However, I also saw individuals acting in a way that they would regret later.

If people asked why I didn't drink, I gave religion as the initial answer.
However, if they pressed on with the inquiry -- there were additional responses.  

There was one more reason -- a family one.

I saw how alcohol wrecked my relatives.

They seemed to be mild, coherent person, prior to alcohol consumption. 
Afterwards, it seemed a darker part of humanity took over.

It seemed they become more bold as restraints were removed.
The alcohol laced relatives were not the people I wanted to be social with.

I was able to spend 4 years in Korea and another 6 years of business dealings with a Japanese firm where alcohol was offered and consumed.

I am glad I didn't participate.

[2 years into the role, a colleague from Texas joined the project.
He indicated he drank.
Japanese hosts unloaded on him.
He could not make it to his hotel without an incident.]

Grateful for the religion and surroundings that encouraged and enforced a life long decision of not drinking alcohol.
Also life's experiences that allowed a choice to pause and react appropriately to `H San`'s disappointment and the ensuing lecture.

## Memories of Japan

I am glad that I suppressed my initial response and overcome jitters of the first evening in Japan.
I remember well those 6 years of working with the Japanese team.

`H San` continued to come to Narita to meet us and guide us through Tokyo Station.
After 3 or 4th visit, he would let us find our way to the Marunouchi (丸の内) Hotel ourselves.

Recall fondly his favorite restaurants in Roppongi(六本木) in Tokyo run by his classmate, and Shabu Shabu place in Hamamatsu (浜松市).

These trips taught me, among others

-   the importance of making the guest/customer feel at ease.
-   know the target for the product and process, work at it and achieve it.^[the Japanese and the American had a very different view on the length and scope of the training]
-   invest in and take part in the local food and culture

Wondered how things would have turned out if a Japanese or American or anyone else that drank took on the role of the Technology Transfer from Shizuoka to Utah.

These days, `H san` and I exchange emails regularly.
He also sends me, lovely, end of the year greeting cards
