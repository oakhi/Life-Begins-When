> We wanted a Japanese person for the role\
> We would have accepted an American project leader\
> But a Korean person that doesn't drink!?!

Thus began my 6 year assignment to coordinate a production line transfer from Fukuroi, Japan to Utah and Texas.

Wondered,

> What happened the description of Japanese people that I had studied prior to the visit.

-   Japanese people are polite, shy, kind and most of the time indirect in communications.

This was not the beginning I had imagined

After an 12 hour flights to arrive at Narita, we were on the way to Tokyo via Narita Express.

Was ready to go home if there was a convenient way and if my director and VP hadn't accompanied me

However, gathering all my patience and relying on past human relationship lessons, I listened to `H san` continued to lecture me on the Japanese business practices...

I recall him saying,

> This is a tight group. One mistake and you are branded.

In other words, be careful, don't let us down.

## Start of the Project

Next morning I met with the team I was to work with.

I wasn't as concerned about the technical aspect of the transfer.

Since I had worked in the industry over 15 years.

I had been chosen for the role, because I knew the Asian culture -- somewhat.

However, the main concern of the project, communicating with my counterpart vanished when I met `K san`.

`K san` had graduated from University of Warwick and had studied British Humor.

## A Social Lubricant

I left Korea before I turned a teenager.

I returned 25 years later. Many things had changed. But not the pervasive use of alcohol.

The director, that I traveled with, described alcohol as a social lubricant. I saw it as neither social nor a lubricant.

It may seem to relax people that drinks. However, I saw individuals acting in a way they would regret.

If people asked why I didn't drink, I gave religion as the initial answer.\
However, if they pressed on with the inquiry. There was one more reason.

I saw how alcohol destroyed my relatives.

They seemed to be mild, a gentle person, prior to alcohol consumption. Afterwards, it seemed a darker, sinister part of them took over.

Not sure if they become more bold or restraints were removed.\
The alcohol laced relatives were not the people I wanted to be social with.

I was able to spend 4 years in Korea and another 6 years of business dealings with a Japanese firm where alcohol was offered and consumed.

I am glad I didn't.

2 years into the role, a colleague from Texas joined.\
He indicated he drank.\
Japanese hosts unloaded on him.\
He could not make it to his hotel without an incident.

I made the life long decision of not drinking alcohol.\
Also not reacting negatively to `H San`'s disappointment and the lecture.

## Memories of Japan

I am glad that I overcame jitters of the first evening in Japan.\
I will remember those 6 years of working with the Japanese team.

They taught me,

-   the importance of making the guest/customer feel at ease.
-   know the target, work at it and achieve it
-   introduce and take part in the local food and culture

Wondered how things would have turned out if a Japanese or American or anyone else that drank took on the role of the Technology Transfer from Shizuoka to Utah.

These days, `H san` and I exchange emails regularly.\
He also sends me, lovely, end of the year greeting cards
