There are many ways to measure precipitation in Utah.

- Watch weather forecast
- monitor Skiing Resort Website
- Go to website, https://snoflo.org/snow/report/utah/
- Watch the flow out of canyons during spring/summer

Of these the last one is passive and untimely.

On a good year, the temporaray flow starts around spring (march/april) and go until Memorial Day or beyond.

Flow in the Spring is like a youthful flow

Then heard a noise not often heard during winter months.
It was a man made water flow from the aquifir replacement project
