## Complementary and Complimentary

Sum up 35 years of married life.

My parents lived the complementary life and not so much on the complimentary side.

Afterall theirs was an arranged marriage

Low expectation that builds into it.

Committed to the institution of marriage.

My grandparents generation had no options


## Not Competitive
