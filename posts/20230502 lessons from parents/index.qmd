Been feeling guilty and having regrets

Feeling of, not doing more for or spending more time with, my parents when they were with us.

Now that both are no longer here, I miss the opportunity of visiting and talking with them.

I expected them to be here forever. Almost got my wish, since they took care of me for 6 decades.\
For that I am most grateful and feel blessed

Still, there is an occasional void and finality, a feeling that I will never hear them or see them again.

It would be great to talk to them and receive feedback filtered through their years of experience.

Or listen to one of their stories about growing up in North Korea -- before and after communism took place, memories of Japanese occupation years, and nearly miraculous preservation during the Korean War.

## A Resolve

However, in recent weeks, I have begun to feel that I can still do something for them.

That is, to live the life they endeavored to live. Based on their teaching and their understanding of the Gospel.

They prepared the foundation and showed us how to be a representative of a Korean but more importantly a Christian.

My parents longed for this but didn't have the full opportunity to fulfill it.

## You don't have to live like a refugee.

During my high school years, a popular song contained these lyrics,

> We did something we both know it We don't talk too much about it...

My parents always lived as if they were refugees, even when they options.

Always working hard and saving money, expecting another inflation, depression, or even a war might destroy their lives.

I once told my dad, after suggesting that he try something new

> "Dad, there are better and more convenient way now days"

He answered in essence,

> "I know there are better ways, but this method suits me fine and I don't want the easier, more costly method"

My parents were independent.

I am convinced that both of them could out work vast majority of the population. Out-Scrooge virtually anyone.

My parents, once they set their minds to it, were not movable.

They experienced horrors of communism, demand and control of colonialism and a war caused by, exacerbated by and fought among and eventually separated families.

They had a reservoir of knowledge because they experienced them firsthand.

This knowledge or wisdom served them well.

They taught us how to live this life, as if we are still at war. How to recognize value and save for the future generations, even if we don't get to enjoy it ourselves. How to distinguish things of this world vs. next world

Thank you Mom and Dad.

I hear your counsel as I take a hike along the mountain.\
Your stories are retold to my mind when I take time to contemplate

I am beginning to understand how to see everyday problems and events of the world as you saw them.

It would be a blessing, to be recognized in the future this way,
