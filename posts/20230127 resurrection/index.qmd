> 26 그리고 나 야곱은 내가 반드시 곧 나의 무덤으로 내려갈 것임을 알아, 나의 아들 이노스에게 이르기를, 이 판을 맡으라 하고, 또 나의 형 니파이가 나에게 명한 것을 그에게 말하였더니, 그가 명에 복종할 것을 약속하였느니라. 이제 나는 이 판에 나의 기록함을 마치노니, 그 기록한 것이 작았을지라도 많은 나의 형제들이 내 말을 읽기를 바라며, 읽는 자에게 작별을 고하노라. 형제들아 잘 있으라.

> 26 And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the record of this people being kept on the other plates of Nephi, wherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days

Jacob 7:26, Book of Mormon

My parents' and my wife's parents' lives were as if a dream.
They lived their lives mostly in solitary, lonesome world for them.

Through much tribulation, they tried their utmost against life's challenges and left us a far better life.

## Mourning Practice in Old Korea

When I was little, it was common to see those lost their parents to wear a marker on their clothes or on their hair.
It was made from a particular clothes and shaped like a small bow tie.

In the olden days, a son was to build a shack by the tomb and spend 3 years of his life by the deceased.
The logic was to pay back to parents what they did when we were little.
3 years of raising us, therefore spend 3 years of caretaker by the grave.

This type of reasoning did not survive the modern Korean thinking.

The introduction of Christianity and perhaps the increased practice of cremation may have brought about the certain demise of this practice.

## A story about regrets

A well know story about not listening to one's parents is told through a story about a wayward green frog.

There was a green frog that did exactly the opposite of what he was told.
The mother frog tried to change the son, time and again she failed.
She turned old and was about to die.

She made her final request.  

> "When I die, please bury me on the bank of a river"

When she died, the son followed her words this time.  

> “I always did the opposite of what she told me when she was alive,” he said to himself, “but now I will do exactly as she told me.”

The green frog sat in the pouring rain by the river bank, crying and crying for his mother. And that is why, to this day, the green frogs cry when it rains.

## Personal Regrets

2 things on my mind,

- Why didn't I spend more time with them?
- Why wasn't I more kind to them when I was with them?

The belief in Christianity and faith on Christ brings some solace.

Primordial light

English Translation © Richard Stokes

> O red rose,
Man lies in direst need,
Man lies in direst pain,
I would rather be in heaven.
I then came upon a broad path,
An angel came and sought to turn me back,
Ah no! I refused to be turned away.
I am from God and to God I will return,
Dear God will give me a light,
Will light my way to eternal blessed life.

Urlicht

> O Röschen rot,
Der Mensch liegt in grösster Not,
Der Mensch liegt in grösster Pein,
Je lieber möcht ich im Himmel sein.
Da kam ich auf einen breiten Weg,
Da kam ein Engellein und wollt mich abweisen,
Ach nein ich liess mich nicht abweisen.
Ich bin von Gott und will wieder zu Gott,
Der liebe Gott wird mir ein Lichtchen geben,
Wird leuchten mir bis an das ewig selig Leben.
