The number 38 is significant to all Koreans.

But for those born north of the 38 degrees latitude, it means far more.

It means longing for a home, that is beyond reach, in this lifetime.

My father's home is
함경도 안변군 신모면 이남리 47
about 10 miles south of present day Wonsan port 
About 150 miles Northwest from Seoul.

My father's family was living in this remote part of Korea, when his maternal uncle, 김동훈 traveled by foot to find the family.

The uncle convinced the family life would be better in the South.

My father's family was settled in Southern Korea.
He had a chance to work for a Japanese company 

Few years later, when Japanese left, he became the owner of the home that belonged to a manager.

He was all of 15 years of age.

Later he was drafted in the South Korean army and was on a weekend leave when the fighting broke out on Sunday, June 25th, 1950.

Father fought in major battles of Korean War and he wondered how he survived those battles.

Father thinks, had he remained in North Korea and had fought for the North Korean, he would met a quick death.

Father always had appreciation for the uncle that sought out the family and led them to a freer and a land with more opportunities
