My seminary teacher, Carol Rawlins, passed away this week.

She and her husband, Stephen Rawlins, gave directions and provided an anchor during my high school years when important decisions needed to be made.

By her example, she provided an insight into this quote by the former head of the United Nations.

It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses.
Dag Hammarskjold

She made you feel like you were that, one individual.
That individual in turn, having felt the love, can influence other individuals.

Thank you Sister Rawlins for the service and love.
Thank you Rawlins family for sharing your mom with us.
