The year was 1969, my dad and his friends were wrapping up their employment with RMK-BRJ consortium in Vietnam.

Having experienced overseas living they wanted to work elsewhere and explored opportunities outside of Korea.

They consider such countries as, Brazil, Australia, Canada, and Japan -- Kyushu area in particular.

But they all decided they'd rather go to United States

The remaining question was where in the United States.

They looked at a map and one person suggested that they should live near the capitol city -- Washington DC

The reasoning was that there will be more cultural opportunities near Washington DC.

Some of these friends have grown up together since early childhood back in Won San[^1]

[^1]: Won San is some 150 miles northeast of Seoul, in area that is called North Korea

They fought in the war together, they worked together after the war and they came to Vietnam to work together.

Now they planned to immigrate to United States with their families.

My father would start the next phase of his life in Greenbelt, Maryland -- He was 44.

## Searching for an American Religion

When my father returned home in April of 1970 he noticed there were missionaries.

They were street contacting near one of the rotaries (roundabouts) in Incheon.

Since he had interest in overseas living, he invited them home.

But he had no interest in religion.

However my mom did, she would study with the missionaries for two years.

She studied and prayed.

After receiving a personal revelation and listening to visiting Elder Harold B Lee speak she was convinced of the truth.

She and three of her children were baptized in May of 1971 (Eastern Branch)

My father delayed his study and conversion.

His primary focus was moving the family to the US.

After a few setbacks, he finally attained work visa to United States in February/March of 1974.

He soon left for the United States and our family joined him on the 29th of April 1974.

Even though my parents didn't express it at the time, life as an immigrant in their 40s was not easy.

Not only work but the language was a burden that the first generation immigrants had to bear.

They endured their lot as immigrants knowing that their children will have far better opportunities.

So what seemed like a random decision, choosing to work and live in Maryland turned out to be a tremendous blessing for our family.

We had more cultural and as an added bonus, more religious opportunities.

Washington DC Temple was open to public and dedicated the year we arrived.

> What is a successful immigrant family? Had we gone elsewhere, what would have the outcome? What was unique about Maryland Silver Spring Stake?

6.  Strong Family Bonds

Not sure how our lives would have been if we didn't go to Washington DC area as a family.

Our parents would have made sure we survived the initial stages as a new arrivals.

Based on those traits listed, we did OK, because we were among Saints.

In addition knowing that I needed extra help. We were sent to the Carrollton Ward.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I remember going to school and because I knew no English how was the sign several teachers so that I could catch up.

One of them was Sister J, the wife of the Bishop. Furthermore, that Bishop's son served in Korea. He came home and taught my father and baptized him.

I struggled through school years, like most young people. Having friends in and support from the church kept me going and kept me out of trouble.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Going on a mission was something that was discussed nor encouraged at home.

Grateful for those that encouraged and supported me.

I left my mission on January 1983

Grateful all of the families that I got to meet in Maryland

Invited me to scout camps, summer camps to Goshen, VA, young men young women activities, .

Especially memorable and transformational event was in 1980, a gathering of young people from all over eastern seaboard.

Men were kept in Ferrum College, women in Radford.

For someone that hadn't traveled much out of Washington DC, southwestern VA did seem like 'almost heaven.'

People were equally nice.

Newly elected Orrin Hatch and Young Women President Cannon were keynote speakers.

What an event, it made me realize I was part of something big

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now those families have moved back to their home in the West.

Mostly to Utah, Idaho and Arizona.

Grateful for those families that have helped me during those memorable years, 1974 to 1983.
