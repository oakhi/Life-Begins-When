She recognized others and welcomed them into her home and her heart.
This in turn made them feel or regain their true worth.
People remembered, responded and attended her farewell memorial. 

Her love of culture and people and words was demonstrated and felt during a memorable evening in Provo.

Her four children, reflecting her passions, all spoke eloquently

First daughter spoke about an analogy (attributed to her younger brother) of being carried to the next adventure on a symbolic canoe or boat.

Her second son, spoke of time he asked about the origins of Gods.

“Who was God’s Father?”

Though no definite answer was given, he felt her sincerity and care in answering his question.
He developed a lifelong love of/for wisdom, in theology.

Each chose a few words their mother captured as a poem.

The music was equally superb.

The Ward Choir sang My Sheperd will Supply my Need with Organ, Piano and a Flute accompaniment

Was doing until the closing hymn was sung

`Be Still My Soul`

>...With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain.
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
...Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

With beautiful voices harmonizing around me, I thought of the Scandinavian spirit, or Nordic countries and the symbols they chose – the Cross

## Other Thoughts

> What will next generation remember?

After the service, saw a tall young man next to me. For the next 5 minutes, it escaped me who he was.

Finally realized he was son of the 2nd son of Jackie.

He was a foot taller than I remembered or I had shrunk a foot over the years

I just remembered him as a early teenager in the Ward.

That was the image locked into my mind.

> My tragedy was that I wanted to be a celebrated violinist at any price. Since the age of 15 I played my violin practically from morning to night. I hated pen and ink—unfortunately I preferred an elegant violin bow. My love for the violin lasted quite long and it was a very painful awakening when I had to admit that I had begun my training for the exacting career of a virtuoso too late.
