Snowstorms before Christmas brings memories of years past, as a student --- and a father.  
June and I had 2 children before graduating from school.

Around Halloween, we brought our 2nd child, a son, home to a 500 square foot apartment.

It was snowing.

Our daughter welcomed home her brother and played with a doll with black hair like her.

I should have been worried, no terrified, about finishing school.
Also obtaining a job that would pay sufficiently.

June directed and took care of matters so that I can focus on school tasks and worry less about the future.  
Recently, have learned the steps she had to take to live on a student budget.
We cut out even necessary things to get by.

One of the few entertainment options was a video/pizza place on Canyon Road.  
For a couple of bucks, one can order a plain pizza and rent a videocassette movie.

Glad that we didn't have internet and social media those days.  
It forced me to stay in school and work with others to get the work done.  
Also, there were no distractions on what other people were making or doing.  

Because of her effort, and some family support, I was able to complete school and find a job.
I was happy to have job, not too concerned about the salary. 
It was another 7 years before my salary matched our needs.

Even now, I recall how she encouraged and comforted me and made sure that home was welcoming and had freshly prepared meal ready.
Because of it I didnâ€™t know how desperate the situation and bleak the future really was.

Now, those 2 children are raising a family of their own.  
They are supporting one another and establishing a home of their own.
