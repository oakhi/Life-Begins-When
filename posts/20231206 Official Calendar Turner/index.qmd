One of the advantages of working for a Japanese company affiliate is tasting the sweets that people bring following a business trip.

Regional delicacies from Niigata (新潟県), famous treats from Tokyo like Tokyo Banana.

And even chocolates from Belgium.

---

Another distinction are beautifully crafted calendars from vendors in Japan.

A new scenery is displayed every 2 months.

As I was turning Sep/Oct into Nov/Dec. I noticed that the place depicted seemed familiar.

![立石寺, 山形県, from Ohara 2023 Calendar](yamadera.jpg)

Yet the name listed on the calendar, Risshaku-ji (立石寺) I didn't recognize.  But the prefecture seemed familiar -- Yamagata 山形県

An internet search and a confirmation with a colleague from Niigata showed its alternate designation, Mountain Temple or 山寺

It was the same temple that I had visited before, during one of the business trips.

Immediately became more connected with the image on the calendar.  

I would keep and frame those captured images of beautiful locations

Names, designations for places, cities and prefectures may change but places like Yamadera will retains its rightful designation -- `A Temple in the Mountains`.

## Temple in Canyons and Mountains

That temple in the mountain gave a new appreciation for workmanship of dedicated people.
It will stand the throughout ages.

There is a building nearby in Utah that also gave much memories

This temple has been place of inspiration and solace.

Also a place of gathering for missionaries in general and for a random (not planned?) encounters with family members that were in the MTC.

Calendar pictures or photos of place and buildings bring back many memories 

## Yield to a new era

Calendars occupy a certain space and time and must yield to new period of time

Similarly, buildings that have served its purpose are replaced by more modern and convenient design.

However, there are cultures that value things of old and seem outdated.  

Some culture favors new buildings with modern designs

Elsewhere a standard for longevity are in centuries and millenia.

Some seem to measure in terms of years and decades.

A preference for progress and a new-start over preservation and continuity.

## Building Lasting Memories

Memories associated with these buildings will outlive the physical building and this life.

It will take some time to adjust to the new building that will grace that spot in the canyon.

Thank you, the temple in the canyon, the canyon itself, and the people in the area.

You have given me and many many others a lifetime of memories.
