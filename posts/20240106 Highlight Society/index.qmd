Living in the Washington DC area during the 1980s was a bonus.

The NFL Football was playing well and the local TV personnel matched the level.
George Michael and Glenn Brenner in particular.
The former pioneered the highlight show and the latter mixed humor with the sports.

It appears George Michael's approach is more adaptable to the current technology.

It is easy to depend on the highlight or even someone else interpretation of what has happened.

Rather than investing hours of watching the game develop

While this approach may work for sports, the similar approach to life will not work.

Highlight of life or an event may serve the curious minds
But it is the low light that defines the person

Perhaps having the surrogate is an option


Best is being in person.

To save time, watch the highlight. Who determines what is the highlight

Do we get the same experience without watching the lowlight of the event.
