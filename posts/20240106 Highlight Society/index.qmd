Didn't realize it then, but...

Living in the Washington DC area during the 1980s had its share of bonuses.

The NFL Football Team was playing exceptionally well and the local TV personnel matched the level. George Michael and Glenn Brenner in particular. The former pioneered the highlight show and the latter mixed humor with the sports.

It appears George Michael's approach is more adaptable to the current technology.

It is easy to depend on the highlight or even someone else interpretation of what has happened.

Rather than investing hours of watching the game develop and experiencing the drama created.

This approach of watching highlights and listening to interpretations of others may work for sports.

However, this approach in life will not be beneficial.

Highlight of life or an event may serve the curious, forgetful and even lazy minds.

But it is the low light that defines the person

Perhaps having the surrogate is an option

Best is being in person.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To save time, watch the highlight of a sporting event

Who determines what is the highlight

A biased view of an event.

Then reading the comments makes it more biased.

The person(s) playing the game have said more eloquently than can ever be described.

Unless there at the stadium don't the crowd response

Unless actually played the game, no way to determine what actually happened

Do we get the same experience without watching the lowlight of the event.

That is why I miss my parents perspective.

They lived through the occupation, communism and the war.

Having gone through those trials, they treated the challenges as they should.

With the help from above, they accepted what life brought.

No need for interpretation, highlight reels, just live life as is.

Earth has high light and low light season, depending on the angle of the sun.

Have lived most of life around the latitude 40 degrees north.

Abundant sun in the summer, low fading light in the winter

When do I appreciate the sun more?

Is it too hot or cold, just wait 6 months.

Is life too difficult, wait for the cosmic, life cycle to turn.

Life at Singapore (latitude in single digits) seemed to have 2 variants, hot and steamy and hot and rainy.

Not sure if life in Hawaii (20 degrees latitude)

New Carollton (39)

Incheon (37.8)

Mesa (33)

Anchorage(61)

Sapporo (43)

Helsingborg (56)
