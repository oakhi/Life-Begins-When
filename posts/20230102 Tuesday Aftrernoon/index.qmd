Been going through dad's study area.

Letters, certificates, photos and some books.

Church books, `명상록` (瞑想録) by Marcus Aurelius, `Maxims and Proverbs of Old Korea` 한국속담 by Ha Tae Hung.


My parents had their favorite sayings.

- 소문난 잔치에 먹을 것 없다 
  - There is nothing to eat at a rumored feast
- 젊어서 고생은 사서도 한다
  - people even pay for a hardship in their younger age
- 양약고구(良藥苦口, 良 좋을 량, 藥 약 약, 苦 쓸 고, 口 입 구)
  - bad taste in mouth, good for the body.

More importantly they taught by example, not only how to handle difficult situations but teaching that life is a long journey.

Grateful that they shared their life's lessons and that guided my life and made it had meaningful.

How can I help to ease their way?  
Now they must learn from one another  
Day by day"
