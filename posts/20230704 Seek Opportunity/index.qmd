> Don't go looking for opportunities, they will come looking for you

That was the parting, reassuring statement from my manager as I ended the 4 year assignment in Korea.

Unfortunately, things didn't happen as he predicted. I had to look for and apply to opportunities since those words were spoken 20 years ago.

Experiences gained during those ensuing years have taught me these alternate interpretations.

-   You have done something significant for you and the company, and we appreciate it.
-   You have skills that are well suited for this and similar roles.
-   Opportunities, is it defined by us, the company or by God?

## Opportunities : A Company Perspective

Early in my career, first 5 or 6 years, I was bound to my office.

Never attended a seminar, a conference or visited a manufacturing location outside of Utah.

Then in 1997, a colleague invited me to travel to Suzhou (苏州, 蘇州).

We were to transfer a set of equipment that make catheters.

For the next 10 years, I would travel extensively.

Also the company asked me to live abroad and help with acquisition and transition of Korean Medical Device companies.

The arrangement was mutually beneficial.

I was providing a service that was in demand, a knowledge of local language and culture plus the knowledge of specific set of catheter manufacturing knowledge.

At some point, I made a mistake of thinking that companies exist to serve my needs.

It is the other way around.

## Opportunities : A life-long Persepective

> Was the manager incorrect in saying that opportunities will come?

Similar to company/individual relationship that can be defined as life's opportunities, Rabbi Manis Friedman provides another perspective.

> We do not have needs, God does. and He has a plan.  
> He will use us, rather, we will partner with God  
> To achieve purposes of our creation

Since the assertion by that manager, there has been a number of set-backs and disappointments, but were they actually opportunities?

-   How should I view/accept my recent role, working with the Japanese team?
-   Was it to fulfill my needs or did I partner with God in any degree?
-   How many opportunities were lost, not even considered, because I was inward focused?

The opportunity, as we define it in terms of our needs, may not come along.

However, other forms or representations, that are in effect opportunities will be available.

These may start out as educational training, conference attendances, a reminder from a family member, a message from a friend, an invitation to join a team by a former colleague.

Therefore, by seeking the needs of God and understanding His plan, we can educate ourselves and make ourselves more suited for that role.
