My mother will be coming home in a few days.

She has been in the Utah Valley Hospital and Provo Rehabilitation & Nursing since November 10th.

Grateful to dedicated workers, technology, and the grace of God.

For unknown reasons, her right arm began to swell and changed colors -- to purple.

Workers performed blood tests, administered IV and blood transfusion and managed her pain.

Doctors at the hospital determined that acute symptoms have abated and discharged her to the rehabilitation facility across the street, to recover and to return home.

But her arm didn't get better.

Although Rehab facility personnel tried their best with their given resources, my mom's pain and the swelling increased.

As a last resort, her daughter-in-law pleaded with administrators to send her back to the hospital for evaluations -- to find the cause.

A nurse from the radiology admission area came to take mom to the CT (computer tomography) Scan area.

When the nurse saw the condition of the arm, she changed the directive and wheeled my mom to the emergency area.

Because of the action of that nurse, mom was able to get both the CT Scan and the Ultrasound of her arm and increased attention on pain management.

The evaluations showed that there was a pseudo-aneurysm in her artery near the fistula.

The solution was to inject Thrombin into the area that was leaking blood.

The surgery was performed on the day before Thanksgiving.

It was successful and mom avoided more invasive surgery.

Now she can begin the 4-week recovery.

Thankful to be living in a time and place that has access to the latest medical advancements. To live among men and women with the knowledge and practice medicine with wisdom.

To those men and women that responded and answered the prayer and pleading of the daughter-in-law and shewed mercy and was a neighbor to strangers - thank you.
