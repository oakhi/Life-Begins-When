Went through 65 video tapes containg family or home recordings [^1]

[^1]: These are stored in magnetic tapes, first developed in Germany back in 1928 [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape#:~:text=Magnetic%20tape%20is%20a%20medium,magnetic%20wire%20recording%20from%20Denmark.)

These recording contains first 15 years of our married life. Arrival of children and visits by family members and visits to places in US and abroad.

After 200 hours of viewing, editing, digitizing, and uploading these memories, these are some lessons learned\^\[Analog to Digital transfer is a real time process, and conversion from DV format to MP4 format takes roughly 2X times. 2 minutes of DV video takes about 4 to 5 minutes to convert to MP4 format).

-   Note : Discussions on the travel will be limited to that visit to Europe as a family some 20 years ago. \*

## Lesson 1 : Children live on encouragement

11 month old child is about to fall again, but he takes another step. Siblings are cheering, mom and dad are extending their hands. The child smiles as he takes one step after another.

When children are litle and they are trying something new, everyone encourages him or her. As they grow older, not so much attention.

Why is that so?

## Lesson 2 : It is not how but where

Visited Europe as a family, a part of tour package. We flew across Siberia, bused through Alps[^2], trained across France on TGV, flew across the Channel.

[^2]: tunnels were closed due to a fire

Our destination was major cities of the western Europe.

We were glad to be there with the family and that our parents could join us.

## Lesson 3 : Not Now but Soon

Knowing major events that occurred and its sequence, it was interesting to see people going about their day to day, normal activities.

As Sister K points out,

> If you knew what would happen 5 minutes in the future, you would die either because you will be too happy or too sad.

In this life, not knowing in full is normal.

## Lesson 4 : Our parents showed us how to live

ON that trip to Europe, my father was 70, my mother was 68. Yet, not only they kept up with young people but also helped with little ones. They also had curiosity and wanted to learn as much as possible

On life's journey, it is good to have seasoned guides . Also to see how to age well and not be afraid of life.

## Lesson 5 : Focus on the People

Doesn't matter how you get to your destination, it is the people that you travel with that matters.

Was surprise how unimportant and unintersting various modes of travelling. Trains, Buses, Airplanes, Boats, are some of means of getting to destinations. But after few decades, it seemed to matter the least in those footages.

People, however, were interesting to look at. How they conversed, how they spent their time.

## Lesson 6 : Buildings vs Nature

Buildings were interesting at the time of visit Viewing again, it is a fixed object whereas people have grown, changed and moved on.

One is static, man-made, decaying The other is evolving, renewed, and eternal.

Hard to capture majesty of nature. We will always try, either using photography or videos. Most important is the feeling or inspiration gained and whether our lives have changed because we came in contact with the nature

## Lesson 7 : Importance of Meals

I may not recall most of the sites that we visited. However, I can remember all of the meals we ate.

-   Chinese meal in London.
-   Escargo in Paris
-   Fondue in Chamonix
-   Pasta in Florence
-   Pizza in Rome

Perhaps it was the local (except in London) preparation, every dish was delicious.

Maybe it was that we were all starved from tightly scheduled tours.

Dining afer a long day of travel with the family -- that was a highlight.

## Lesson 8 : Let Children be Free

Saw a number of instances with Sister K and I tried to have our children act in certain way or say something the way we envisioned.

Forced compliance.

Best videos all had this in common. It was spontaneous. Letting children say and do based on their understanding at that time.

One of the memorable moment was when our 3.5 year old daughter and her 2 year old brother acted out the highlights of Snow White -- all from her memory.

## Lesson 9 : Not where but when

The travel was tightly planned. For the most part, it went as planned.

But when the train ride through the Alps was replaced by a bus ride, it meant we arrived in Milan at night.

We saw the city in darkness and took pictures of the cathedral in night-light mode.

Pictures and videos were disappointing

Living near a mountain, we know the terrain and guess the weather pattern based on the night and morning sky.

That allows us to be at certain location at a given time to capture the ideal images.

## Lesson 10 : There is beauty all around

I would jump at an opportunity to travel to Europe or Asia again. However, if my international travel days are over, I am satisfied with my past journeys.

For I have discovered that near home and at home is where most significant events and people are.

And greatness and beauty are not in a well known location or well advertised (reviewed) restaurants, or well chronicled sites.

But greatness and beauty are made and captured a little by little, some captured on digital medium but most are captured in hearts and minds of individuals that have been touched and served with love.

Life is wonderful and lovely, both near and far.

We can usually predict, with a high degree of accuracy, whether
