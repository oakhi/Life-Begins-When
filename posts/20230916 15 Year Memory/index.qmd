Went through 65 video tapes[^1], containing family or home recordings.

[^1]: a magnetic tape-based 8mm videocassette

These recordings contain the first 15 years of a married life, arrival of children and visits with family members and visits to places in the US and abroad.

The Analog to Digital transfer took over 200 hours.[^2]

[^2]: Analog to Digital transfer is a real time process, and conversion from DV format to MP4 format takes roughly 2X times. 2 minutes of DV video takes about 4 to 5 minutes to convert to MP4 format

After viewing, editing, digitizing, and uploading these memories, this is a summary of lessons learned.

## But Who

Before starting, I imagined I would save, some of the well known places, in the video.

However, very few images of places or things were saved into the digital format, they were not that interesting anymore.

The Great Wall, The Vatican, The Eiffel Tower, to name a few.

Yes they are marvels of human achievement, but if I decided to visit them next month, they will still be there.

But the scenes with the people -- I kept.

Those that I lived, worked or traveled with are no longer here or are living far away or have grown up.

Those scenes with a familiar people were captured and shared.

There were several instances, where forgotten moments and unexpected guests appeared on the screen.

One such event was a 1-year birthday celebration at the Wymount Terrace.

People were squeezed to a 143 square feet space, it was difficult to recognize, due to low resolution, but there were faces that recognized and I haven't seen in decades.

People accepting and taking a moment from their schedule to participate.

Making memory for the parent and the child, even though the child is seen crying because of the heavy, uncomfortable costume.

## But Now

It was wonderful to see our parents age through their 60s, 70s and 80s with vibrancy -- finally slowing down in their late 80s.

Setting a model for us to follow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

11 month old child is about to fall again, but he takes another step. Siblings are cheering, mom and dad are extending their hands. The child smiles as he takes one step after another.

When children are little and they are trying something new, everyone encourages him or her. As they grow older, not as much attention, attempting something more noble.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greatness and beauty are made and captured little by little, some captured on digital medium but most are captured in hearts and minds of individuals that have been touched and served with love.

Life is a wonderful gift.

Can be experienced near or far, preferably near.\
Either now or in the future, rather to be enjoyed while young.\
To be shared with those that are near - now.
