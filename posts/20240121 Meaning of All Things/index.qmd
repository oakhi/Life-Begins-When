Attend a weekly conference. 

At this conference, a personal guidelines are presented -- both from very old to pre teens. Not the same person or a group of people each week but a person chosen among the neighborhood congregation.

We get an insight into their lives and the blessings of the gospel.

This conference can also be called the `Meeting of a Neighborhood` or the Sacrament Meeting on the Sabbath.

A young man passed the sacrament to the congregation for the first time.
He seemed like he was closer to the baptism age than the priesthood age.

He was passing the sacrament along with his father.
There were others that were at least foot or taller than he.

Young Sister E, spoke of growing up in the household of gospel learners.
How attending the early Seminary impacted her life.
Visiting the Sacred Grove and re-affirming her testimony

Then Sister A spoke like we were part of a General Conference.
She acknowledged and thanked members of the congregation.
She reflected a life well lived.
Soothing, from the heart.

He compared the journey of the Lehi's family in the wilderness as a microcosm of our earthly life

We have a choice to be a willing participants, like Nephi was.
Or murmur like the first 2 sons, Laman and Lemeul.

## Difficulty of an abridger/editor

There were 3 major editors of the Book of Mormon.

Nephi, Mormon and Moroni.

Roughly 2 pages per year^[Over 500 pages covers 1000 years of history].

## Weakness in their language

D&C 1:24

> 24 Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these acommandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their blanguage, that they might come to cunderstanding.

He described the process of translation

The person sees images, conveys and writes its meaning in written language

He then made this analogy, borrowing from Neal A. Maxwell

## An Hurried Tourist

> May we come to feel as a whole people beckoned beyond the entry hall. May we go inside far enough to hear clearly the whispered truths from those who have “slumbered,” which whisperings will awaken in us individually the life of discipleship as never before^[https://rsc.byu.edu/voice-my-servants/book-mormon-great-answer-great-question].

Bone marrow transplant followed.

He lived to be 29 years of age^[

The teacher concluded with the words,

> 17 And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.

Until that time when the meaning of all things will be made known...
