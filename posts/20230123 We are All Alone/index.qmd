> Outside the rain begins And it may never end\
> So cry no more, on the shore a dream\
> Will take us out to sea\
> Forevermore, forevermore

> Close your eyes and dream\
> And you can be with me\
> 'Neath the waves, through the caves of hours\
> Gone, forgotten now\
> We're all alone, we're all alone

> Close the window, calm the light\
> And it will be all right\
> No need to bother now\
> Let it out, let it all begin\
> Learn how to pretend

> Once a story's told It can't help but grow old\
> Roses do, lovers too, so cast Your seasons to the wind\
> And hold me dear, oh, hold me dear

> Close the window, calm the light\
> And it will be all right\
> No need to bother now\
> Let it out, let it all begin\
> All's forgotten now\
> We're all alone, all alone

> Close the window, calm the light\
> And it will be all right\
> No need to bother now Let it out, let it all begin\
> Owe it to the wind, my love, hold me dear

> All's forgotten now, my love\
> We're all alone
