> *\"When you're happy, you enjoy the music but when you're sad, you understand the lyrics\"*

â€• Frank Ocean\

I have been contemplating lyrics lately.

Not necessarily because I am sad but because of my age and reflection on the days of our existence.


At a recent wedding, the couple danced to the music that accompanies these lines

*I know your eyes in the morning sun*

*I feel you touch me in the pouring rain*

*And the moment that you wander far from me*

*I wanna feel you in my arms again*

(How deep is your love?, Bee Gees 1977)

This was played during my high school days.

\
A corollary to Frank Ocean\'s statement might be,

> *When young, one dances to the music*

> *When old, one contemplates memories invoked by lyrics.*

\

During high school days, we owned a record album called "Silk Degrees"\

It produced 4 singles and the album peaked at #2 on Billboard charts.

Back then, listened to who controlled the radio station playlist.

(Also there were no way of finding the official version of the lyrics.
At times, it may be advantageous to leave the lyrics ambiguous.
Used to think, `learn not to pretent`, instead of `learn how to pretend`)

While the hit singles were up-beat and dance-ready, the one that I recall and listen now is

`We are all Alone`\

> Outside the rain begins And it may never end\
> So cry no more, on the shore a dream\
> Will take us out to sea\
> Forevermore, forevermore

> Close your eyes and dream\
> And you can be with me\
> 'Neath the waves, through the caves of hours\
> Gone, forgotten now\
> We're all alone, we're all alone

> Close the window, calm the light\
> And it will be all right\
> No need to bother now\
> Let it out, let it all begin\
> Learn how to pretend

> Once a story's told It can't help but grow old\
> Roses do, lovers too, so cast Your seasons to the wind\
> And hold me dear, oh, hold me dear

> Close the window, calm the light\
> And it will be all right\
> No need to bother now\
> Let it out, let it all begin\
> All's forgotten now\
> We're all alone, all alone

> Close the window, calm the light\
> And it will be all right\
> No need to bother now Let it out, let it all begin\
> Owe it to the wind, my love, hold me dear

> All's forgotten now, my love\
> We're all alone
