From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Korea) 

> Catholicism was first introduced during the late Joseon Dynasty period by Confucian scholars who encountered it in China. In 1603, Yi Gwang-jeong, a Korean diplomat, returned from Beijing carrying several theological books written by Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit missionary to China^[KIM Han-sik, 'The Influence of Christianity', Korean Journal XXIII, 12, December 1983, p. 5.].

According to my sister, mom's family attended a synagogue, participated in the Baptist congregation, and joined a Prebysterian faith, by the time mom's father was of age.

Hwang Family were always searching for the truth.

Even as the country turned ideologically communist, Christians and my mom's family maintained their faith in God

My other sister told me about an uncle who escaped a firing squad.
Communists gathered religious leaders and they were to face death as a group.

The uncle fell and pretended to be dead before the bullets hit the prisoners.

As other prisoners fell by the bullet, they wound up on top of him.
He thought he had escaped death, until the bayonet check almost cost him his life.

After 20 years of participating in Presbyterian faith, my mom, as her family before, was still searching.

My father met missionaries as they were street contacting in Incheon.

My mother had many questions that were answered by missionaries, a visit by Elder Harold B. Lee. 

One day, as she was studying scriptures, she dreamed.

In that dream, she saw 2 books on a table.
One was the `Bible` and the other was the `Book of Mormon`
A hand was also shown and as the hand was waved between 2 books, a voice was overheard.

All these experiences along with her faith enabled to accept the gospel as thought by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latte-Day Saints.
