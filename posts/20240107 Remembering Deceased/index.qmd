Growing up in Korea, I remember seeing a bow, made from the sackcloth.
Men would pin it on their shirt and the women on their hair.

This was to signify that they are in mourning.  Often for 3 years.

In the olden days, people would spend 3 years next to the grave.
The same period as the parents taking care of little ones.

Relief has come.

I don't recall seeing anyone wearing those sackcloth bows now days

How are we to know if someone is in mourning?

---

How do we know how others feel

Last Breeze flight from Provo to Phoenix

The plane was roughly half full, was hoping there would be empty seats.
It was not to be.

I was seating on the aisle seat 22D to be exact.
2 ladies came to the row 22.

The younger lady with a headphone took the window seat.
The older lady began asking questions.

I wished I had brought a noise cancellation headphone

I was flying without a carry on.  Since I had left most things in AZ
It felt good to just have a tote bag 
It meant I had to leave some essentials behind.

She asked where I was headed.
I gave some generic, non-revealing answer.

She started the dialogue saying she was on a women-only retreat after her sister's funeral at Salt Lake.

I gave in and revealed a little.

I was heading to a family member funeral in Phoenix

She said her sister was 40 years old with few kids.
The cancer overtook her.

At this point I was thinking
Of nearly 200 people in the plane, she and I shared something in common.

Was this a coincidence, a random occurrence?

She and I talked for the duration of the flight.

She mentioned that her parents were very strict and it drove some children away from the faith.

I was grateful that she took time to explain her circumstances even though I was not a willing participant.

Grateful that fate intervened and I was comforted by sharing our common experiences

Ancients and progenitors devised a way for people to mourn and a way to let the world know.

Currently, we celebrate happy moments together.
Many ways, including social media, balloons and T-shirts.

However, we seldom, especially men, share the grief with others.

I want to thank the person in seat 22E, on that flight 

It helped me ease my burden
