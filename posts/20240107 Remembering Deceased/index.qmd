Growing up in Korea, I remember seeing a bow, made from the sackcloth. 
Men would pin it on their shirt and the women on their hair.

This was to signify that they are in mourning. 
Often for 3 years.

In the old days, people would spend 3 years next to a grave. 
Matching the same period as the parents taking care of little ones.

Times have altered traditions.
Periods mourning have been shortened as well as the method of mourning.

I don't recall seeing anyone wearing those sackcloth bows these days

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How are we to know if someone is in mourning?
How do we know if someone is struggling?
How do we know how others feel at the moment?

## A Breeze Flight from Provo to Phoenix

The plane was roughly half full, was hoping there would be empty seats. 

It was not to be.

I was seating on the aisle seat 22D to be exact. 
2 ladies came to the row 22.

The younger lady with a headphone took the window seat. 
The older lady began asking questions.

I wished I had brought a noise cancellation headphone

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was flying without a carry on. 
Since I had left most things in AZ 
It felt good to just have a tote bag 
It meant I had to leave some essentials behind.
Including a noise cancellation device for listening to music and isolation from others

She asked where I was headed. 
I gave some generic, non-revealing answer.

She began the dialogue with a story.
She was on a women-only retreat to Tucson, after her sister's funeral in Salt Lake.

I gave in and revealed a little.

I was heading to a family member funeral in Phoenix.

She said her sister was 40 years old with few kids. 
The cancer overtook her.

At this point I was trying to calculate the odds.
There are nearly 200 people in this plane, Airbus 220.

She and I shared something in common and we were having a conversation about losing someone very close.

Was this a coincidence, a random occurrence?
She and I talked for the duration of the flight.

She mentioned that her parents were very strict and it drove some children away from the faith.

I was grateful that she took time to explain her circumstances even though I was not a willing participant.

Grateful that fate intervened and I was comforted by sharing our common experiences

Ancients and progenitors devised a way for people to mourn in private.
Also publicly -- if one chooses.

Currently, we celebrate happy moments together. 
In diverse ways, including social media, balloons and T-shirts.

However, we seldom, especially men, share the grief with others.

I want to thank the person in seat 22E, on the flight MXY 620.

It helped me ease my burden by both listening and expressing our common experiences.

Neither one of us wore a distinguishing marks.
But one of us was sensitive enough to open up and share her sister's life and death.
