There is a song, all adults in Korea over 50, can sing from memory.

Its refrain says

> 언제나 돌아오는 계절은 나에게 꿈을 주지만   
> 이룰 수 없는 꿈은 슬퍼요 나를 울려요

*Each season brings a renewed cycle of hopes and dreams*  
*However, unrealizable dreams are inconsolable and bring tears.*

The song is about past romance, separation, and regular remembrance during each fall.

At one level of interpretation.

When young, almost all events and songs can be related to and viewed in terms of relationships - both good and meaningful -- ones that endure and those that end abruptly.

However, the expectation is that seasons and times will return and repeat, indefinitely.

For those that have lived a half-century or more, this inevitability sets in with force -- the realization that there are finite cycles of seasons left.

Not necessarily because of the ordinal age but because life places and sets in motion a number of markers and reminders.

More dependent on the younger generation, mentally, emotionally and physically. 

Loss of hope for the future, that things will get better is no longer believed or pursued.

The reduction in self-reliance and independence due to these surges can have a significant impact on one's long term outlook and the day to day well being.

About 5 years after that melancholy song was released, another group proclaimed the following

> 우리 타는 가슴 가슴마다 햇살은 다시 떠오르네.

*Within our burning bosom, rises another source of light.*

Later verses state,

*I have another act to perform in my life,*
*Even though I stand on the edge of wind-blown field, I am not lonely*
*Yet, when a pine needle falls, my tears follow.*
*With our changeless love for another, I will lift those in need by lending a helping hand*

Mercifully, as years go on, goals and relationships are either adjusted downward or allowed to fade from our memories. 

In coming days and years, I may vacillate among melancholic remembrance of past relationships, missed opportunities and abandoned dreams.  

However, each day, I will believe, reach for and rely on the strength of individual and collective human will to continue and overcome.

## Forgotten Season (잊혀진 계절)

지금도 기억하고 있어요 시월의 마지막 밤을  
뜻모를 이야기만 남긴채 우리는 헤어졌어요   
그날의 쓸쓸했던 표정이 그대의 진실인가요    
한마디 변명도 못하고 잊혀져야 하는 건가요   
언제나 돌아오는 계절은 나에게 꿈을 주지만   
이룰 수 없는 꿈은 슬퍼요 나를 울려요  

I still remember the last night of October   
We broke up leaving only meaningless stories behind   
Is the lonely expression of that day your truth?   
Can't even make a single excuse, should I be forgotten?   
The seasons that always return give me dreams  
Dreams that can't come true are sad, they make me cry

## With Love (사랑으로)

내가 살아가는 동안에 할일이 또 하나 있지   
바람부는 벌판에 서 있어도 나는 외롭지 않아.  

그러나 솔잎 하나 떨어지면 눈물따라 흐르고   
우리 타는 가슴 가슴마다 햇살은 다시 떠오르네.  

아 영원히 변치 않을 우리들의 사랑으로   
어두운 곳에 손을 내밀어 밝혀 주리라.  

while i live I have one more thing to do   
Even if I'm standing in a windy field I'm not alone.  

But if one pine needle falls flowing with tears  
Each of our burning hearts the sun rises again  

Oh, with our love that will never change  
I will reach out my hand in a dark place and shed light on it^[translation by Google Translate].
