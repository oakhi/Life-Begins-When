    "text": "Spent 9 years living in a suburban Washington DC area, Maryland.\nThat was the beginning of our lives in the United States.\nThose years can be recalled in terms of where we lived and what school we attended.\nRather, those years were years of association with a unit known as the Carrollton Ward.\nThat was a great blessing for the Kang Family.\nImmigrants seek a better life elsewhere\nMainly for education and economic improvement for future generations, religious liberty, asylum from persecution and family strife.\nMy family came for 3 out of 4 reasons.\nIn the end religion became the defining reason.\nAs an immigrant I learned how to read, write and speak in English through the Prince George’s county school system.\nHowever, I learned how to live this life, as a follower of Christ, in a congregation of saints"

    "text": "First few years of Transition\nFiguring out the church schedule was a challenge, since we couldn’t understand the announcement. We missed our share of meetings due to Stake and General Conferences and missed the starting time, due to not understanding the Daylight Savings Time.\nOur language improved and Brother Bacon from Terre Haute, IN became our Home Teacher. For the next 5 years, he faithfully visited our home.\nWe became more involved in the Ward\nNot always, but attended the weeknight meetings as well.\nThat led to participating in Road Shows, summer camps and a church wide celebration.\nSummer camps and Father and Sons campout were those rare occasions to see places other than a cityscape\n\nThe Sesquicentennial celebration in Roanoke and the surrounding area in 1980 was a defining event for a young person.\nThe magnitude of participation, from the mid-atlantic areas, as well as the depth of commitment demonstrated by participants made a deep impression.\nThe Ferrum College and the surrounding areas of Roanoke Conference Center opened up a new chapter for a young immigrant person.\n\nWe attended church in Korea after the War.\nFor adults, it was a religion.\nFor a young person, it was a chore to walk to and from church often at night\nHearing wild animals added to the sense of sacrifice and an adventure.\nFor many of us, Christmas was a foreign tradition.\nSnacks or treats offered during Easters and Christmas were definitely highlights.\nThen our family, mainly through my mother’s conversion, joined another congregation. It was not a popular choice then. But my mother was convinced that it was the right choice for her and the family.\nWithin 3 years, we were boarding a plane headed for Anchorage. On our way to a new home in the Washington DC area.\n[How Washington DC was chosen, see, ]\n\n\nI remember gatherings in Maryland at Christmas time.\nWas asked to learn Christmas Carol to be sung at the Church. Not exposed to music up until then, I struggled to learn, but I still recall the refrains of Angels We Have Heard...\n\nParticipated in Christmas Devotional at the Church. Where many difficult concepts were explained in plain, parent-like mannners.\nMy father became one of the Wisemen at a church play. That participation meant a lot to him and for us.\nRecall a Christmas Eve gathering at a home, where people are invited to visit, stay or go according to their schedule. Plenty of goodies were served. Remember thinking, when I have a chance, I want to have a gathering like this.\nThis and many other gatherings helped me realize what a family centered, the community assisted living was like.\nAccording to Ephesians,\n\n19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;\n\nThank you Carrollton Ward Members."

    "text": "Met the parents of my mission companion.\nThe meeting was the post General Conference Korean Fireside hosted by the Korean Ward located in the Orem Sunset Stake. 1260 S 400 W, Orem, UT 84058\nAs long as I can recall, Koreans have always met separately after the conclusion of the General Conference.\nI remember as a missionary, seeing a contingent from Korea addressing Korean Saints in the LA area. LA Olympic Korean Ward. 1209 S Manhattan Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90019\nAlso during the early 1980s, visitors would meet in the old 7th East Building. 2450 S 600 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84106\nAs the Korean Branch/Ward expanded during the last couple of decades, meetings have been held in various buildings in the Edgemont Area of Provo, as well as in Midvale. 8350 Jackson St, Midvale, UT 84047\nI don’t recall much of what was said by speakers in those gatherings. I do remember meeting old friends and meeting new acquaintances A warm feeling of being with fellow believers and hearing comforting words in language of my father and mother.\nAny other group would say 5 sessions and nearly 10 hours of gospel-centered messages would be sufficient.\nNot Koreans.\nThey want to hear directly from their leaders A statement of those principles in their native language. As well as soak up any and all Korea related news.\nAs a bonus, this year, an Area 70 from Japan attended. Elder Imai said, he found out that his ancestors were from Korea\nFormat and people attending has changed over the years. But there are few families and individuals that did not change over time\nMy mission companion, Elder Pak, was from North Ogden. He is the youngest of 6 children and the only son in the family.\nAlso met the husband of his oldest sister. 김상현. He mentioned that E. Pak is doing quite well as an orthopedic surgeon. Owns 2 hospitals and 2 homes in Buena Park and Huntington Beach. His daughter chimed in, “He is in Peru now, arranging a bike ride back to US”\nThought to myself, my companion has done real well.\nThen the daughter mentioned their mother has dementia and has moved in to help out.\nIf she hadn’t mentioned it, I would not have realized, since she recalled and we talked normally about past events.\nAs I talked to the father more, I realized he sounded a lot like my own father.\nSo I ventured and asked where he is from. He said, he has lived in Incheon but he is originally from 함경도 Hamkyung Do. Just few miles from my father’s hometown. (he lived about the same distance as Ogden to Provo).\nFor a few minutes, thought I was listening to my own father speaking. That unmistakable pattern or 사투리 (억양 抑揚 or intonation) that only North Koreans from 함경남도 (咸鏡南道) area can express..\nThank you Paks. Thank you Father.\n\n\n\nDad and 고모 [姑母] aunt"

    "text": "Searching for an American Religion\nWhen my father returned home in April of 1970 he noticed there were missionaries.\nThey were street contacting near one of the rotaries (roundabouts) in Incheon.\nSince he had interest in overseas living, he invited them home.\nBut he had no interest in religion.\nHowever my mom did, she would study with the missionaries for two years.\nShe studied and prayed.\nAfter receiving a personal revelation and listening to visiting Elder Harold B Lee speak she was convinced of the truth.\nShe and three of her children were baptized in May of 1971 (Eastern Branch)\nMy father delayed his study and conversion.\nHis primary focus was moving the family to the US.\nAfter a few setbacks, he finally attained work visa to United States in February/March of 1974.\nHe soon left for the United States and our family joined him on the 29th of April 1974.\nEven though my parents didn’t express it at the time, life as an immigrant in their 40s was not easy.\nNot only work but the language was a burden that the first generation immigrants had to bear.\nThey endured their lot as immigrants knowing that their children will have far better opportunities.\n\n\nSo what seemed like a random decision, choosing to work and live in Maryland turned out to be a tremendous blessing for our family.\nWe had more cultural and as an added bonus, more religious opportunities.\nWashington DC Temple was open to public and dedicated the year we arrived.\n\n\nWhat is a successful immigrant family? Had we gone elsewhere, what would have the outcome? What was unique about Maryland Silver Spring Stake?"

We were sent to the Carrollton Ward.\n\nI remember going to school and because I knew no English how was the sign several teachers so that I could catch up.\nOne of them was Sister J, the wife of the Bishop. Furthermore, that Bishop’s son served in Korea. He came home and taught my father and baptized him.\nI struggled through school years, like most young people. Having friends in and support from the church kept me going and kept me out of trouble.\n\nGoing on a mission was something that was discussed nor encouraged at home.\nGrateful for those that encouraged and supported me.\nI left my mission on January 1983\nGrateful all of the families that I got to meet in Maryland\nInvited me to scout camps, summer camps to Goshen, VA, young men young women activities, .\nEspecially memorable and transformational event was in 1980, a gathering of young people from all over eastern seaboard.\nMen were kept in Ferrum College, women in Radford.\nFor someone that hadn’t traveled much out of Washington DC, southwestern VA did seem like ‘almost heaven.’\nPeople were equally nice.\nNewly elected Orrin Hatch and Young Women President Cannon were keynote speakers.\nWhat an event, it made me realize I was part of something big\n\nNow those families have moved back to their home in the West.\nMostly to Utah, Idaho and Arizona.\nGrateful for those families that have helped me during those memorable years, 1974 to 1983."
