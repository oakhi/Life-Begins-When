    "text": "Snowstorms before Christmas brings memories of years past, as a student — and a father.\nJune and I had 2 children before graduating from school.\nAround Halloween, we brought our 2nd child, a son, home to a 500 square foot apartment.\nIt was snowing.\nOur daughter welcomed home her brother and played with a doll with black hair like her.\nI should have been worried, no terrified, about finishing school. Also obtaining a job that would pay sufficiently.\nJune directed and took care of matters so that I can focus on school tasks and worry less about the future.\nRecently, have learned the steps she had to take to live on a student budget. We cut out even necessary things to get by.\nOne of the few entertainment options was a video/pizza place on Canyon Road.\nFor a couple of bucks, one can order a plain pizza and rent a videocassette movie.\nGlad that we didn’t have internet and social media those days.\nIt forced me to stay in school and work with others to get the work done.\nAlso, there were no distractions on what other people were making or doing.\nBecause of her effort, and some family support, I was able to complete school and find a job. I was happy to have job, not too concerned about the salary. It was another 7 years before my salary matched our needs.\nEven now, I recall how she encouraged and comforted me and made sure that home was welcoming and had freshly prepared meal ready. Because of it I didn’t know how desperate the situation and bleak the future really was.\nNow, those 2 children are raising a family of their own.\nThey are supporting one another and establishing a home of their own.\n\n\n\nDecember Sunset"

    "text": "Talk given at Seneca Stake, Spring 2022\nHello brothers and sisters,\nMy topic today is Jesus Christ is my Deliverer, which is taken from Come Follow Me, Exodus Chapters One to Two.\nThere are many ways the Lord can deliver His children from the challenges in life.\nWhen the ancient Israelites were in Egypt, they faced huge hardships.\nThey were slaves.\nThey were forced to do hard labor.\nThey had no hope for a better life.\nSo what did they do?\nIn Exodus Chapter 2, Verse 23, it reads,\n\n“They cried … unto God” for help.\n\nAnd the Lord answered their prayers.\nHe remembered His covenant people and sent Moses to help free them.\nMoses was a tool to guide the children of Israel to the Promised Land. Through Moses, who received authority from the Lord to act as His prophet, there were many miracles.\nThere is the story of Moses parting of the Red Sea to escape the Egyptians.\nThere is also the story of the people of Israel receiving manna, or bread, from heaven.\nThe Lord also told Moses to split a rock to provide water to the people in the desert, which Moses did.\nAll these miracles happened along the people of Israel’s journey back to the Promised Land.\nThe Lord physically and spiritually sustained them.\nIn a very significant way, the Lord guided my family to the United States of America.\nIn Ether Chapter Two Verses 9 and 12, it reads that the Americas is “a land of promise” and a “choice land.”\nThe Lord delivers us from our struggles and bad situations.\nHow do I know this?\nBecause He delivered my mother from living under a communist regime.\nMy mother’s family were Christians for three generations, at the time, but they lived in fear in North Korea.\nUnder the government, the ultimate punishments for Christian worshippers were being sent to do time in a hard labor camp or the firing squad. She kept her faith by praying daily at night under a thick blanket.\nShe was like the people of Alma in the Book of Mormon, who prayed in their hearts to avoid punishment from their enemies. He heard my mother’s prayers and I know that He answered her prayers.\nDuring the Korean War some seventy years ago, her family and other refugees were evacuated to a safer area in South Korea, thanks to the assistance from the United States Navy. 1\nWhile the war raged on, my mother and her family rarely lost hope and constantly prayed for the peace in the land. She saw miracles on many occasions, such as when the meager rations lasted longer than expected and also when her family received help from strangers, countless times.\nThe Lord delivered my mother’s family.\n\n\n\nMom, center 2nd row, attending a Protestant Church 1960s\n\n\nWhen my father was twenty years old, he was drafted into fighting for the South Korean Army during the Korean War. He was captured and tortured by the enemy on at least three different occasions.\nHowever, he managed to escape from his captors and reunited with his army unit each time. He told me countless times that he was led by the powerful impressions to know when and which direction to run during his escapes.\nOne time, after being captured, the enemy soldier told my father that he was “too young to die” and he was spared from execution.\nI am thankful to the Lord that He delivered my father from certain death.\n\n\n\nFather during the late 1950s\n\n\nHaving seen the horrors of war first-hand, my parents decided to emigrate to the U.S.\nThe Lord can deliver our family from difficult situations by inspiring a way to escape, in this case, emigrate to the chosen land.\nMy family has been blessed to be in this country and to be members of the Lord’s restored and true Church.\nAll of my children have served missions for the Church in Southern California and South Korea.\nMy nephews and niece have also served missions in New York City, Washington State, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan.\nDon and I are serving in the Washington, D.C. North Mission.\nIt has been a great blessing to serve among the young missionaries and the senior missionaries. We have learned so much about the inner workings of the mission and how many sacrifices are made to do the Lord’s work here in this area, and also throughout the world.\nI would not have guessed that we would be serving a mission in our home region if you had asked me several years ago. But here we are, and we are loving this opportunity to serve the Lord in order to pay Him back for delivering us from our trials.\nOur prayers are with those in Ukraine at this time, and we know that the Lord will deliver them during these troubled and difficult times just as He did for my family in Korea. Though many Ukrainians are not of our faith, their faith has gotten them through the difficulties of war and they have declared that God sustains and supports them.\nAs the Lord declared, “Peace I give unto you.” He will bless us with peace and He will deliver us from our trials.\nIn Doctrine and Covenants Section 84, Verse 88, the Lord told the early Saints that He will send angels to us:\n\n“And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”\n\nIn closing:\nI know that the Lord Jesus Christ has power to deliver me from problems and troubles just like He did with the ancient Israelites. I know my Savior lives and loves me. I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe ship described by mom here was the LST class, Landing Ship Tank↩︎"

My curiosity was piqued.\nI didn’t have to ask much, the man anticipated my queries and explained in detail about the feeding pattern, places to watch, best times to see.\nHe knew so much about the deer herd of Rock Canyon. He showed me when to look (during mealtime), where to look (30-40 feet above the trail), and what to look for (herd of deer).\nI had never seen a deer herd before meeting this man with a scope.\nSince meeting with and coaching from the man, I can’t avoid seeing the herd.\nOne day, during a snowstorm, I saw a group of deer, moving together on a well-defined path, along the south edge of the Squaw Peak, about 200 feet above where I was.\nSo what seemed like a rhetorical question by my dad, turned into a specific teaching moment for me about the survival of deer in the wintertime.\n(Perhaps my dad, who has passed away, was gently influencing the man with the scope to teach me a thing or two)\nSo in this life, it seems, that one can pose a question or raise an issue and others may solve it for us. Or one can jump in and try to find, not only the answer, but also implement the solution once found.\n\nAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:\n\n\n\n\nRock Canyon Deer Herd\n\n\n\nFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."

She used to say, you know you have been around for a while when you can remember 3 generations that came before you and can see in person 3 generations that will carry on the legacy.\nShe would make that special sound of joy that only she can make whenever she met young people or babies.\nShe was able to think clearly and make quick and correct decisions. Amazed that she maintained this ability to the very end,"

She would tell me how she carried on even through the death of her father and the Korean War. She was telling me you can do this with faith in Christ.\nVisited with our uncle, my father’s youngest brother who is 13 years younger than my father. He mentioned how mom elevated his status as a human being. She insisted that he finish college when only 20% of the population had college degree Also the per capita income in Korea at that time was $100 USD per person1.\nThrough means only she could have figured out, She encouraged my uncle and he was able to finish his studies and he is indebted to our mother as we are\nShe showed us by being a wonderful mother, a faithful wife, and loving Grandmother.\nShe endured and showed us how to live this life fully and we must follow in her footsteps.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ"

At times, it may be advantageous to leave the lyrics ambiguous. Used to think, learn not to pretent, instead of learn how to pretend)\nWhile the hit singles were up-beat and dance-ready, the one that I recall and listen now is\nWe are all Alone\n\n\nOutside the rain begins And it may never end\nSo cry no more, on the shore a dream\nWill take us out to sea\nForevermore, forevermore\n\n\nClose your eyes and dream\nAnd you can be with me\n’Neath the waves, through the caves of hours\nGone, forgotten now\nWe’re all alone, we’re all alone\n\n\nClose the window, calm the light\nAnd it will be all right\nNo need to bother now\nLet it out, let it all begin\nLearn how to pretend\n\n\nOnce a story’s told It can’t help but grow old\nRoses do, lovers too, so cast Your seasons to the wind\nAnd hold me dear, oh, hold me dear\n\n\nClose the window, calm the light\nAnd it will be all right\nNo need to bother now\nLet it out, let it all begin\nAll’s forgotten now\nWe’re all alone, all alone\n\n\nClose the window, calm the light\nAnd it will be all right\nNo need to bother now Let it out, let it all begin\nOwe it to the wind, my love, hold me dear\n\n\nAll’s forgotten now, my love\nWe’re all alone\n\n\nBoz Scaggs - 1976"

The basement opens up to the ground level on the west side.\nFrom her kitchen, she could see the Y-Mountain. Mount Timpanogos can be seen from the living room.\nMother and Father would convert a yard with grass into a gardening area that produced vegetables year around, except for the winter.\n\nIt contradicted what I envisioned as a retired person. In fact, my mother farmed until the very last, worked during the season of growing.\n\nShe was very independent. She would not use a wheel chair, no walker and definitely no canes for her.\nHowever, during the last few months of her life, she could not negotiate those steps. In addition, the snowfall made it dangerous for her to walk to the curbside.\nOne option was for her to move downstairs. Basement had a direct access to outisde and the driveway, thus no stairs involved.\nHowever, she would miss the sunlight that main level provided, especially on those cold winter days.\nWe discussed further.\nThe thought of sending mother to an assisted living was never brought up, since the thought never crossed our minds. We were united in keeping our mother at her home.\nThen, my wife suggested the following.\n\n“…I will carry her on my back…”\n\nMy mother is a small person, but still carrying a person down a flight of stairs is no simple task. Not to mention going back up those same 14 steps while carrying a person on the back.\nIn a small measure, we were able to give back all that our parents provided over the years.\nPerhaps in a very small means, we were able to do unto others, things they are not able to do on their own."

The logic was to pay back to parents what they did when we were little. 3 years of raising us, therefore spend 3 years of caretaker by the grave.\nThis type of reasoning did not survive the modern Korean thinking.\nThe introduction of Christianity and perhaps the increased practice of cremation may have brought about the certain demise of this practice."

Each snow removing session is also unique and a strategy driven event.\nUse the shovel-and-throw-over-shoulder approach or the plow-until-you-can't-push\nIt is magical how snow reaches the ground and covers everything.\n\nHow are layers of snow deposited on surfaces?\n\nIt it temperature driven?\nIs there a industrial equivalence?\n\nWhich factors determine rain, freezing rain and snow?\n\n[Not only the scene but the sound changes after snow, things are more serene and quieter.]"

LA Olympic Korean Ward. 1209 S Manhattan Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90019\nAlso during the early 1980s, visitors would meet in the old 7th East Building. 2450 S 600 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84106\nAs the Korean Branch/Ward expanded during the last couple of decades, meetings have been held in various buildings in the Edgemont Area of Provo, as well as in Midvale. 8350 Jackson St, Midvale, UT 84047\nI don’t recall much of what was said by speakers in those gatherings. I do remember meeting old friends and meeting new acquaintances A warm feeling of being with fellow believers and hearing comforting words in language of my father and mother.\nAny other group would say 5 sessions and nearly 10 hours of gospel-centered messages would be sufficient.\nNot Koreans.\nThey want to hear directly from their leaders A statement of those principles in their native language. As well as soak up any and all Korea related news.\nAs a bonus, this year, an Area 70 from Japan attended. Elder Imai said, he found out that his ancestors were from Korea\nFormat and people attending has changed over the years. But there are few families and individuals that did not change over time\nMy mission companion, Elder Pak, was from North Ogden. He is the youngest of 6 children and the only son in the family.\nAlso met the husband of his oldest sister. 김상현. He mentioned that E. Pak is doing quite well as an orthopedic surgeon. Owns 2 hospitals and 2 homes in Buena Park and Huntington Beach. His daughter chimed in, “He is in Peru now, arranging a bike ride back to US”\nThought to myself, my companion has done real well.\nThen the daughter mentioned their mother has dementia and has moved in to help out.\nIf she hadn’t mentioned it, I would not have realized, since she recalled and we talked normally about past events.\nAs I talked to the father more, I realized he sounded a lot like my own father.\nSo I ventured and asked where he is from. He said, he has lived in Incheon but he is originally from 함경도 Hamkyung Do. Just few miles from my father’s hometown. (he lived about the same distance as Ogden to Provo).\nFor a few minutes, thought I was listening to my own father speaking. That unmistakable pattern or 사투리 (억양 抑揚 or intonation) that only North Koreans from 함경남도 (咸鏡南道) area can express..\nThank you Paks. Thank you Father.\n\n\n\nDad and 고모 [姑母] aunt"

Her family traces her lineage back for nearly thousand years and they are majority owner in a village next to 현충사(顯忠祠)1\nHowever, my side of the family, because most family members still live in North Korea, we can count on 2 hands, those that are directly related to us.\nWe had a wonderful month long visit to June’s hometown and her ancestral home.\nI remember sleeping the main bedroom when we visited their old home. They graciously let us sleep in the most comfortable room and they slept in the guest room. I can still recall hearing the cicadas buzzing sound as we slept.\nIn addition, my family came to Korea to celebrate my dad’s 60th Birthday and my grandmother’s 80th Birthday.\nSeeing all my families together, some I hadn’t seen in nearly 20 years, made me feel more homesick and I resolved that I would find a way to visit more often.\n\nBut my desires for international travel didn’t materialize for a long time.\nThen it happened.\nIn 1997, a trip to Suzhou, China was arranged.\nIt was a trip to plan an equipment transfer from Sandy, Utah to Suzhou, China plant. This was the beginning and it opened many more opportunities.\nThe company was expanding into Asia and I met people who travel to overseas, assess potential business acquisition and formulate strategies to integrate those company.\nI wanted to be part of it.\nThen a year later, a VP of World Wide Manufacturing calls me into his office.\n\nWould you interested in moving to Korea with your family and work on integrating Korean manufacturers into the world wide group?\n\nI could have given my answer right then.\nHe suggested June and I traveled to Korea and see if this is something I wanted to do.\nThen to bolster my confidence, he said as I left his office.\n\nYou are probably the only person on this earth capable of handling this role.\n\nStarting in the fall of 1998, I was using the passport on a monthly basis. Sometimes weekly, since the Asian Pacific HQ was in Singapore.\nBy May of 2000, 2 months prior to expiration date, I ran out of pages on the passport."

Rice, water, soy sauce and emergency provisions\nTheir life was centered around work. They didn’t stop until last few years of their lives.\nThey were fiercely independent in thoughts or ideals.\nA discussion on relative merits of different forms of government was a non-starter.\nFor them there was only one, the one that guarantees the opportunity or freedom of and for its people.\n\nI never fully understood their way of living nor was I, at times, proud to be part of the family.\nThere is no doubt in my mind, they did their best to give us a safe, god-fearing, kind to others life.\nThey give me strength and hope that I will ultimately arrive at the refuge that I have been seeking.\nMom and Dad, thank you.\n\nAre we still running?\n\n\n\n\nGimpo Airport, 1966?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/employment-based-immigrant-visas.html↩︎"

I believe that eased her longing for both Koreas, North and South.\nShe would watch the daily KBS News, and also keep up to date on popular celebrities, (연예인, 탤런트) or singers.\n\nI remember, growing up, she would rent a dozen or so VHS tapes to view her favorite series, 연속극(連續劇)\nAlthough I watched few episodes of Jewel in the Palace (대장금/大長今) and Moon Embracing the Sun (해를 품은 달) I resisted her invitation to watch those programs with her since it took a considerable time and commitment.\nAnd I also knew they were well written and acted and their period customs were both accurate and well made.\nSo I avoided watching them, knowing how addictive they were.\nMy standard reply was,\n\nI am already involved in a real life Korean-drama in this family.\nWhy do I want to watch another on TV?\n\nShe knew more about the Korean entertainment scene than most people one-half or one-forth her age.\nAnd her enthusiasm for the Korean Wave preceded the general public by a decade or two\nHowever, when she moved to Utah in her late 70s, she lost her network of friends who kept her updated and who used to share those DVDs and VHSs and her access to her familiar or go-to Korean TV channels and programs, available via the Dish TV.\nShe never got adjusted to internet-based programming.\nMy son got her the Google TV and that helped her with YouTube and other offerings.\nThen she and I began hearing about a drama from friends in far away places and subsequently read up on a world-wide phenomenon, known as CLoY, Crash Landing on You (사랑의 불시착).\nBefore I knew about the story line, my wife informed me that the leading character was someone she liked based on Secret Garden series\nI knew Ms. Son from the movie, Classics.\nThe story line, set in today’s Korea dealt with defectors crossing DMZ back and forth - a dream for those from the North.\nThis sounded like a must-see Korean Drama.\n\nSo my mom and I started watching the series together.\nFell immediately for the characters, especially those depicting villagers in North Korea and Korean People’s Army (조선인민군), in addition to leading characters.\nFor those supporting cast members spoke just like my mom and dad, my uncles and aunts, with the Northern Accent.\nMy extended family, when they gather, they subconsciously let go of decades-long practice of using the Southern Accent.\nEndearing me further was the scene and practices of a life in North Korea, that was closer to the Korea I grew up in the 60s and 70s.\nThe black market scene brought back memories of those days when everything seemed to be in short supply and beyond the affordability of most people.\nWhenever I go back to Korea, I am taken back by the growth and affluence.\nMost of the time, I feel like I am from a developing country.\nEveryone seems to be a well dressed model and have jumped out of magazines or they can readily jump into a Korean Drama or a number of “Korea’s Got Talent” like shows.\nIt was a rare treat to see North Koreans depicted with care and accuracy that made me feel that there were distant cousins and other family members that I may meet in the future.\nAnd that there may be a few areas in common that we can begin the conversation.\nMy mom and I finished the series in a matter of days, often viewing 2 to 3 episodes at a time.\nFor a brief time, the series took us to another place and time and brought us a hope for possible unification and a chance to unite as a family.\n\nThat was two years ago.\nNow that my parents have departed this life, there is little to no prospect of uniting with my parents’ family in North Korea.\nEven if the boundaries were opened tomorrow and we could travel to the hometown or ancestral homes of my parents, would the Kang/Hwang family still be there?\nBy miracle that we were able to locate the family, how would we begin the conversation?\n\nHow do you make up for 73 years of no communications?\nAre there any areas of common understanding?\nHow would writers of Korean Dramas write the script for this kind of reunion?\n\nI have an uncle, my dad’s youngest brother, in his 80s.\nHe is the last link, on the Kang side, with North Korea.\n\n\n\nMy uncle is in the foreground, in his early teenage years, middle school perhaps\n\n\nOn my mother’s side, there are 3 surviving younger sisters in South Korea.\n\n\n\nHwang Sisters, late 1960s\n\n\nMy mother has one more sister in North Korea, she is 1.5 years younger than my mother.\nShe may still be alive, but there has been no confirmation of her whereabouts for nearly 75 years.\n\nCrash Landing on You romanticized the 2 sides of a nation still at war.\nProviding a momentary glimpse and a hope that the separated family may once again be united.\nWith each passing year, the generation that experienced the Korean War is dwindling.\nThose that experienced the lasting effect of war, poverty, death and separation of family are aging quickly.\nI do not know if unification will ever take place in the peninsula of Korea.\nEven if it did, I don’t how the families will be reunited and reacquainted.\nEven for the writers of CLoY, it would be a challenge to write scripts for these improbable re-unions\nAlthough it is highly unlikely, I will pray for divine intervention to take place in my lifetime.\nFor, If any nation or people can pull this off, it is the people of Korea, both North and South.\nThey have demonstrated their hard work, post Korean War.\n\n\n\nA Protestant church my mom attended, 1958\n\n\nThey created and experienced the economic miracles that started during the 70s and 80s.\nNow we need a spiritual miracle, a return to god.\nThe God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who was renamed Israel1. link\nGod Almighty, through thy servants, thou hast revealed the truth to the people of Korea, a little by little.\nThou hast also rescued and preserved this country, called Korea, numerous times.\nWill thou hasten the restoration of that nation once more, as one, under God.\nThat we may once again call one another brothers and sisters, which we are.\nWilt thou move the hearts and minds of leaders of 2 Koreas and those nations that have controlling interest in Korea.\nPray that the unification can take place in my lifetime.\nIf it is not thy will currently, will thou reveal steps, send dedicated people, and name sacrifices necessary for the unification to occur in my lifetime or in my children’s lifetime.\nPleading on behalf of my parents’ generation and also for the rising generation.\nGratefully,\nA son of North Korean Parents May 2023\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nBecause Jacob was faithful, the Lord gave him the special name of Israel, which means “one who prevails with God” or ”let God prevail” (Bible Dictionary,”Israel,” 708). Jacob had twelve sons. These sons and their families became known as the twelve tribes of Israel, or Israelites (see Genesis 49:28)↩︎"

    "text": "There is a song, all adults in Korea over 50, can sing from memory.\nIts refrain says\nEach season brings a renewed cycle of hopes and dreams\nHowever, unrealizable dreams are inconsolable and bring tears.\nThe song is about past romance, separation, and regular remembrance during each fall.\nAt one level of interpretation.\nWhen young, almost all events and songs can be related to and viewed in terms of relationships - both good and meaningful – ones that endure and those that end abruptly.\nHowever, the expectation is that seasons and times will return and repeat, indefinitely.\nFor those that have lived a half-century or more, this inevitability sets in with force – the realization that there are finite cycles of seasons left.\nNot necessarily because of the ordinal age but because life places and sets in motion a number of markers and reminders.\nMore dependent on the younger generation, mentally, emotionally and physically.\nLoss of hope for the future, that things will get better is no longer believed or pursued.\nThe reduction in self-reliance and independence due to these surges can have a significant impact on one’s long term outlook and the day to day well being.\nAbout 5 years after that melancholy song was released, another group proclaimed the following\nWithin our burning bosom, rises another source of light.\nLater verses state,\nI have another act to perform in my life, Even though I stand on the edge of wind-blown field, I am not lonely Yet, when a pine needle falls, my tears follow. With our changeless love for another, I will lift those in need by lending a helping hand\nMercifully, as years go on, goals and relationships are either adjusted downward or allowed to fade from our memories.\nIn coming days and years, I may vacillate among melancholic remembrance of past relationships, missed opportunities and abandoned dreams.\nHowever, each day, I will believe, reach for and rely on the strength of individual and collective human will to continue and overcome."

    "text": "Three days from now we will celebrate the the most important birth in history some 2000 years ago to Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem.\nBut for me the the birth of the second most important person in my life occurred 91 years ago on this day to Clyde and Elva Carter in Orem, Utah.\nHer name is Carol Jean.\nThree months and twenty days ago she passed through the veil to return to her Heavenly Father.\nIt was her time to go but not my time to let her go.\nShe has left huge hole in my heart.\nI want to tell you some things about this beautiful feisty woman.\nShe was quiet but tough.\nShe had a very clear sense how she should live her life and once she made up her mind to do something she did it regardless of circumstances.\nHer son, David said of her\n\n“she had an unwavering belief in our potential to do whatever we set our mind to. I know her belief in me made a difference in my life.”\n\nAnd her belief in me made all the difference in my life and I’d like to tell you about it.\nI had grown up on a small farm in Washington state and had not taken college preparation courses in a high school but instead had taken courses to prepare me to go back to the farm.\nFollowing graduation I was working for a farmer harvesting sugar beets when the weather turned cold and froze the beets in the ground. Two of my friends returned from BYU for Christmas break and told me how nice it was at BYU.\nI decided I’d had enough trying to dig frozen beets out of the ground and put my clothes into a cardboard box and took a Greyhound bus to Provo.\nI didn’t plan to stay in school but thought that a few agriculture classes couldn’t hurt.\nI just wanted to get out of the cold.\nIt turned out that my two friends were renting rooms in Carol’s home In Provo and they introduced me to her.\nAt BYU of course I signed up for agriculture classes and Dr. Thomas Martin was my advisor.\nAt the end of the quarter I was in his microbiology class and at the end of it he said\n\n“Mr. Rawlins I would like to see you in my office”.\n\nBeing very shy and insecure I entered with trepidation wondering what I had done.\nHe said to me\n\n“Mr Rawlins I’ve been observing your work and next quarter I don’t think you should take any more agriculture classes. You can learn all that by reading books. I think you should take Math, Physics and Chemistry classes and go on and get your PhD”.\n\nI was completely shocked. This was the furthest thing from my mind.\nBy this time Carol and I were seeing each other occasionally and when I told her of this preposterous suggestion and that I thought Dr. Martin was out of his mind she did did not agree.\nShe had worked as a secretary for him and was aware of his success in helping students obtain advanced degrees.\nShe simply said\n\n“of course you should do it. You can accomplish anything so set your mind to do”.\n\nAnd she never wavered from her belief in my potential.\nWhen the PhD diploma was issued it had my name on it but she was responsible for a huge part of it.\nAs I have looked back I realize that without the confidence I had gained from Carol’s belief in me there would have been no PhD.\nI would not have returned to school and would have simply returned home and got some kind of a job. With my limited resources there is no question that I would not have been a successful farmer but would have probably ended up as a farm worker as many in my family had been.\nWhat a special woman she is.\nI literally owe my life to her.\nAnd it’s impossible to know how many lives like mine have been changed by her example of personal courage and an unwavering belief in their potential.\nWhat a blessing she has been to all us that have had the privilege of having her in our lives.\nOur last six months living in a senior living center have been wonderful.\nWith no external distractions and relatively good health we have spent all of our time doing things together and have grown very close.\nWhen Carol returned from rehab for her hip surgery where I could not spend the night we were so pleased to be able to be together.\nOn the morning a day before she died she rolled over and laid her head on my shoulder and said to me\n\n“I love you Stephen. We are a team. We are tough cookies and together we can handle anything life brings our way”.\n\nAnd with Carol’s example of strength and courage and the help and guidance of our Lord I know I will be able to handle whatever life brings to me including this temporary separation from her.\nSteve Rawlins\n\n\n\nCarol and Steve"

I want to see my face shining in it by morning.\nWestley: As you wish.\nGrandpa: “As you wish” was all he ever said to her.\nButtercup: Farm boy, fill these with water - please.\nWestley: As you wish.\nGrandpa: That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was saying “As you wish,” what he\nmeant was, “I love you.” And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back.\nButtercup: Farm boy ... fetch me that pitcher.\nWestley: As you wish.\n\n\nWhen a relationship is solid, growing, and nurturing, voices are subdued.\nAt times no sound is needed.\nFor \"As you wish\" can be conveyed, just as well, without words\nThe Lord God speaks in a still, small voice.\nWhen people are listening, following, obeying, no dramatic intervention is needed.\nIf not, 災難 (disasters), wars and rumors of war and captivity of nations and souls follow.\nPrincess Bride showed that the dialogues are just as important, perhaps more important than actions in movies – as the popularity of Korean Dramas have recently demonstrated."

He refused to answer our questions, even when we asked him directly.\n\nAbout the only thing he would ever say was how much of a waste of men it was. He claimed he never understood why “kids” his age had to go so far away to kill people.\nBut, in 1992 my mother died. A year later my dad had remarried and came to DC to “see the sights” with my stepmother.\nI volunteered to be their tour guide! One day we were doing the Mall area, visiting the monuments.\nBack then, there was a small eatery near the base of the Washington monument. We went there for some lunch.\n\nThe three of us sat at a small table in the back. A few minutes later an Asian kid asked if he could join us!\nMy dad started asking him questions. He was 18 years old and from Busan, South Korea, and was touring the United States.\nMy dad said, “Oh, I’ve been to Busan, but it is probably in a lot better shape today!”.\nThen the kid asked my dad some questions about my dad’s experience South Korea, which, surprisingly he answered (this is how I now know my dad was in Busan and Inchon)!\nThe kid eventually finished his lunch, asked my dad if he could be excused, and took his trash to the garbage can.\nThen he came back!?\nHe stood in front of my dad at attention and saluted him!\nHe said something like, “Sir, I want to thank you and your fellow countrymen for coming to the aid of my country so many years ago. Because of your sacrifices, people like me could grow up in freedom!”.\nAnd, poof! he was gone, lost in the crowds before any of us could say anything.\nWhen I looked at my dad, there was a tear rolling down his face. After a few minutes, he mumbled something like, “So, that is why we go!!!”. And, after that he never complained about going “so far away”. He still wouldn’t answer any questions us kids had, but lunch that day at the base of the Washington monument changed his outlook on life…and his war.\nSo, it is in this light, I thank you David Kang, for expressing your gratitude! I’m sure, if my dad was alive today, your gratitude would bring another tear to his cheek!!!"
