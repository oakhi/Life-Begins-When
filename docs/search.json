    "text": "Three days from now we will celebrate the the most important birth in history some 2000 years ago to Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem.\nBut for me the the birth of the second most important person in my life occurred 71 years ago on this day to Clyde and Elva Carter in Orem, Utah.\nHer name is Carol Jean.\nThree months and twenty days ago she passed through the veil to return to her Heavenly Father.\nIt was her time to go but not my time to let her go.\nShe has left huge hole in my heart.\nI want to tell you some things about this beautiful feisty woman.\nShe was quiet but tough.\nShe had a very clear sense how she should live her life and once she made up her mind to do something she did it regardless of circumstances.\nHer son, David said of her\n\n“she had an unwavering belief in our potential to do whatever we set our mind to. I know her belief in me made a difference in my life.”\n\nAnd her belief in me made all the difference in my life and I’d like to tell you about it.\nI had grown up on a small farm in Washington state and had not taken college preparation courses in a high school but instead had taken courses to prepare me to go back to the farm.\nFollowing graduation I was working for a farmer harvesting sugar beets when the weather turned cold and froze the beets in the ground. Two of my friends returned from BYU for Christmas break and told me how nice it was at BYU.\nI decided I’d had enough trying to dig frozen beets out of the ground and put my clothes into a cardboard box and took a Greyhound bus to Provo.\nI didn’t plan to stay in school but thought that a few agriculture classes couldn’t hurt.\nI just wanted to get out of the cold.\nIt turned out that my two friends were renting rooms in Carol’s home In Provo and they introduced me to her.\nAt BYU of course I signed up for agriculture classes and Dr. Thomas Martin was my advisor.\nAt the end of the quarter I was in his microbiology class and at the end of it he said\n\n“Mr. Rawlins I would like to see you in my office”.\n\nBeing very shy and insecure I entered with trepidation wondering what I had done.\nHe said to me\n\n“Mr Rawlins I’ve been observing your work and next quarter I don’t think you should take any more agriculture classes. You can learn all that by reading books. I think you should take Math, Physics and Chemistry classes and go on and get your PhD”.\n\nI was completely shocked. This was the furthest thing from my mind.\nBy this time Carol and I were seeing each other occasionally and when I told her of this preposterous suggestion and that I thought Dr. Martin was out of his mind she did did not agree.\nShe had worked as a secretary for him and was aware of his success in helping students obtain advanced degrees.\nShe simply said\n\n“of course you should do it. You can accomplish anything so set your mind to do”.\n\nAnd she never wavered from her belief in my potential.\nWhen the PhD diploma was issued it had my name on it but she was responsible for a huge part of it.\nAs I have looked back I realize that without the confidence I had gained from Carol’s belief in me there would have been no PhD.\nI would not have returned to school and would have simply returned home and got some kind of a job. With my limited resources there is no question that I would not have been a successful farmer but would have probably ended up as a farm worker as many in my family had been.\nWhat a special woman she is.\nI literally owe my life to her.\nAnd it’s impossible to know how many lives like mine have been changed by her example of personal courage and an unwavering belief in their potential.\nWhat a blessing she has been to all us that have had the privilege of having her in our lives.\nOur last six months living in a senior living center have been wonderful.\nWith no external distractions and relatively good health we have spent all of our time doing things together and have grown very close.\nWhen Carol returned from rehab for her hip surgery where I could not spend the night we were so pleased to be able to be together.\nOn the morning a day before she died she rolled over and laid her head on my shoulder and said to me\n\n“I love you Stephen. We are a team. We are tough cookies and together we can handle anything life brings our way”.\n\nAnd with Carol’s example of strength and courage and the help and guidance of our Lord I know I will be able to handle whatever life brings to me including this temporary separation from her.\nSteve Rawlins\n\n\n\nCarol and Steve"

    "text": "At times a popular movie alters and captures the mindset and imagination of a whole generation – and beyond.  \nOne such movie, for my generation, was the Princess Bride, released in 1987.\nThe movie fulfilled a need of that time period by re-visiting tried and true movie making approaches – with a modern twist.\nAction-Romantic-Comedy, not necessarily in the order of importance, would be one classification of the movie.  But like all great movies, it created its own genre and became a source of Vulgate for years to come.\nBeyond its romance tinged plot, the witty dialogue won me over.\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/best-quotes-from-the-princess-bride-list-2017-9\n\n\nGrandpa: Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.\nButtercup: Farm boy, polish my horse’s saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.\nWestley: As you wish.\nGrandpa: “As you wish” was all he ever said to her.\nButtercup: Farm boy, fill these with water - please.\nWestley: As you wish.\nGrandpa: That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was saying “As you wish,” what he\nmeant was, “I love you.” And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back.\nButtercup: Farm boy ... fetch me that pitcher.\nWestley: As you wish.\n\n\nWhen a relationship is solid, growing, and nurturing, voices are subdued.\nAt times no sound is needed.\nFor \"As you wish\" can be conveyed, just as well, without words\nThe Lord God speaks in a still, small voice.\nWhen people are listening, following, obeying, no dramatic intervention is needed.\nIf not, 災難 (disasters), wars and rumors of war and captivity of nations and souls follow.\nPrincess Bride showed that the dialogues are just as important, perhaps more important than actions in movies – as the popularity of Korean Dramas have recently demonstrated."

    "text": "My mother will be coming home in a few days.\nShe has been in the Utah Valley Hospital and Provo Rehabilitation & Nursing since November 10th.\nGrateful to dedicated workers, technology, and the grace of God.\nFor unknown reasons, her right arm began to swell and changed colors – to purple.\nWorkers performed blood tests, administered IV and blood transfusion and managed her pain.\nDoctors at the hospital determined that acute symptoms have abated and discharged her to the rehabilitation facility across the street, to recover and to return home.\nBut her arm didn’t get better.\nAlthough Rehab facility personnel tried their best with their given resources, my mom’s pain and the swelling increased.\nAs a last resort, her daughter-in-law pleaded with administrators to send her back to the hospital for evaluations – to find the cause.\nA nurse from the radiology admission area came to take mom to the CT (computer tomography) Scan area.\nWhen the nurse saw the condition of the arm, she changed the directive and wheeled my mom to the emergency area.\nBecause of the action of that nurse, mom was able to get both the CT Scan and the Ultrasound of her arm and increased attention on pain management.\nThe evaluations showed that there was a pseudo-aneurysm in her artery near the fistula.\nThe solution was to inject Thrombin into the area that was leaking blood.\nThe surgery was performed on the day before Thanksgiving.\nIt was successful and mom avoided more invasive surgery.\nNow she can begin the 4-week recovery.\nThankful to be living in a time and place that has access to the latest medical advancements. To live among men and women with the knowledge and practice medicine with wisdom.\nTo those men and women that responded and answered the prayer and pleading of the daughter-in-law and shewed mercy and was a neighbor to strangers - thank you.\n![](mom.jpeg)"

They are superheroes that we can always count on.\nThey are our parents.\nOne of the challenges of this life is to see our heroes fade away.\nMany in my parents’ generation experienced wars, colonial occupation, famine, torn families, political and economic upheavals, street demonstrations that led to democratic reforms and eventual economic miracle.\nIn particular, my parents had to re-start their lives in 2 different countries – as refugees and immigrants.\nOnce as refugees of a war, from their home in North Korea to South Korea in their teenage years.\nNext as a searching for better economic outcome immigrant to United States in their 40s\nI don’t recall all the individual lessons of my parents.\nI do remember their calm approach to life.\nBecause of their experiences with people, events, and challenges that they had to overcome, growing up, I never saw them panic.\nThey would analyze the situation, draw upon their collective experiences, then formulate a plan to deal with it.  \nIf the burden seemed too heavy, they called on the help from above.\nTheir, not so secret, arsenal was their faith in God.\nBoth of them lived their lives in accordance with this Christian principles,\nTherefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\nAs my wife and I are assuming the role of that generation.\nWe are not prepared for that role and are scared about the future.\nHowever, these things give us hope\nStrength and tender care and love our parents demonstrated.\nA certain knowledge that God is with us.\nWatching and associating with the people of this rising generation.\nThis generation that knows far more than we ever imagined at their age.\nThis generation that is not afraid to tackle tasks, considered too difficult in generations past.\nThank you Mom and Dad, we can count on this new generation of superheroes."

    "text": "“Sir, I want to thank you and your fellow countrymen\nfor coming to the aid of my country so many years ago.\nBecause of your sacrifices, people like me could grow up in freedom!”.\nMy father knew the reason for the war.\nMark A. Wilson’s father had to wait 40 years to find the answer.\nWhen my father passed away (Feb 1930 - May 2020) I wrote his life sketch.\nIt was posted on FB and Mark mentioned his father was born a week earlier and he too served in the Korean War.\nI thanked him for the sacrifice and Mark shared the story of how his father learned the meaning of his service in Korea.\nThank you, all those that have served the country, and in particular, during Korean conflict.\nFor preserving the freedom for the people of Korea.\n\nThank you for your gratitude! My dad died 20 years ago. He never talked about his experiences in South Korea. He refused to answer our questions, even when we asked him directly.\n\nAbout the only thing he would ever say was how much of a waste of men it was. He claimed he never understood why “kids” his age had to go so far away to kill people.\nBut, in 1992 my mother died. A year later my dad had remarried and came to DC to “see the sights” with my stepmother.\nI volunteered to be their tour guide! One day we were doing the Mall area, visiting the monuments.\nBack then, there was a small eatery near the base of the Washington monument. We went there for some lunch.\n\nThe three of us sat at a small table in the back. A few minutes later an Asian kid asked if he could join us!\nMy dad started asking him questions. He was 18 years old and from Busan, South Korea, and was touring the United States.\nMy dad said, “Oh, I’ve been to Busan, but it is probably in a lot better shape today!”.\nThen the kid asked my dad some questions about my dad’s experience South Korea, which, surprisingly he answered (this is how I now know my dad was in Busan and Inchon)!\nThe kid eventually finished his lunch, asked my dad if he could be excused, and took his trash to the garbage can.\nThen he came back!?\nHe stood in front of my dad at attention and saluted him!\nHe said something like, “Sir, I want to thank you and your fellow countrymen for coming to the aid of my country so many years ago. Because of your sacrifices, people like me could grow up in freedom!”.\nAnd, poof! he was gone, lost in the crowds before any of us could say anything.\nWhen I looked at my dad, there was a tear rolling down his face. After a few minutes, he mumbled something like, “So, that is why we go!!!”. And, after that he never complained about going “so far away”. He still wouldn’t answer any questions us kids had, but lunch that day at the base of the Washington monument changed his outlook on life…and his war.\nSo, it is in this light, I thank you David Kang, for expressing your gratitude! I’m sure, if my dad was alive today, your gratitude would bring another tear to his cheek!!!"
