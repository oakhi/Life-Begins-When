    "text": "Snowstorms before Christmas brings memories of years past, as a student — and a father.\nJune and I had 2 children before graduating from school.\nAround Halloween, we brought our 2nd child, a son, home to a 500 square foot apartment.\nIt was snowing.\nOur daughter welcomed home her brother and played with a doll with black hair like her.\nI should have been worried, no terrified, about finishing school. Also obtaining a job that would pay sufficiently.\nJune directed and took care of matters so that I can focus on school tasks and worry less about the future.\nRecently, have learned the steps she had to take to live on a student budget. We cut out even necessary things to get by.\nOne of the few entertainment options was a video/pizza place on Canyon Road.\nFor a couple of bucks, one can order a plain pizza and rent a videocassette movie.\nGlad that we didn’t have internet and social media those days.\nIt forced me to stay in school and work with others to get the work done.\nAlso, there were no distractions on what other people were making or doing.\nBecause of her effort, and some family support, I was able to complete school and find a job. I was happy to have job, not too concerned about the salary. It was another 7 years before my salary matched our needs.\nEven now, I recall how she encouraged and comforted me and made sure that home was welcoming and had freshly prepared meal ready. Because of it I didn’t know how desperate the situation and bleak the future really was.\nNow, those 2 children are raising a family of their own.\nThey are supporting one another and establishing a home of their own.\n\n\n\nDecember Sunset"

    "text": "Talk given at Seneca Stake, Spring 2022\nHello brothers and sisters,\nMy topic today is Jesus Christ is my Deliverer, which is taken from Come Follow Me, Exodus Chapters One to Two.\nThere are many ways the Lord can deliver His children from the challenges in life.\nWhen the ancient Israelites were in Egypt, they faced huge hardships.\nThey were slaves.\nThey were forced to do hard labor.\nThey had no hope for a better life.\nSo what did they do?\nIn Exodus Chapter 2, Verse 23, it reads,\n\n“They cried … unto God” for help.\n\nAnd the Lord answered their prayers.\nHe remembered His covenant people and sent Moses to help free them.\nMoses was a tool to guide the children of Israel to the Promised Land. Through Moses, who received authority from the Lord to act as His prophet, there were many miracles.\nThere is the story of Moses parting of the Red Sea to escape the Egyptians.\nThere is also the story of the people of Israel receiving manna, or bread, from heaven.\nThe Lord also told Moses to split a rock to provide water to the people in the desert, which Moses did.\nAll these miracles happened along the people of Israel’s journey back to the Promised Land.\nThe Lord physically and spiritually sustained them.\nIn a very significant way, the Lord guided my family to the United States of America.\nIn Ether Chapter Two Verses 9 and 12, it reads that the Americas is “a land of promise” and a “choice land.”\nThe Lord delivers us from our struggles and bad situations.\nHow do I know this?\nBecause He delivered my mother from living under a communist regime.\nMy mother’s family were Christians for three generations, at the time, but they lived in fear in North Korea.\nUnder the government, the ultimate punishments for Christian worshippers were being sent to do time in a hard labor camp or the firing squad. She kept her faith by praying daily at night under a thick blanket.\nShe was like the people of Alma in the Book of Mormon, who prayed in their hearts to avoid punishment from their enemies. He heard my mother’s prayers and I know that He answered her prayers.\nDuring the Korean War some seventy years ago, her family and other refugees were evacuated to a safer area in South Korea, thanks to the assistance from the United States Navy. 1\nWhile the war raged on, my mother and her family rarely lost hope and constantly prayed for the peace in the land. She saw miracles on many occasions, such as when the meager rations lasted longer than expected and also when her family received help from strangers, countless times.\nThe Lord delivered my mother’s family.\n\n\n\nMom, center 2nd row, attending a Protestant Church 1960s\n\n\nWhen my father was twenty years old, he was drafted into fighting for the South Korean Army during the Korean War. He was captured and tortured by the enemy on at least three different occasions.\nHowever, he managed to escape from his captors and reunited with his army unit each time. He told me countless times that he was led by the powerful impressions to know when and which direction to run during his escapes.\nOne time, after being captured, the enemy soldier told my father that he was “too young to die” and he was spared from execution.\nI am thankful to the Lord that He delivered my father from certain death.\n\n\n\nFather during the late 1950s\n\n\nHaving seen the horrors of war first-hand, my parents decided to emigrate to the U.S.\nThe Lord can deliver our family from difficult situations by inspiring a way to escape, in this case, emigrate to the chosen land.\nMy family has been blessed to be in this country and to be members of the Lord’s restored and true Church.\nAll of my children have served missions for the Church in Southern California and South Korea.\nMy nephews and niece have also served missions in New York City, Washington State, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan.\nDon and I are serving in the Washington, D.C. North Mission.\nIt has been a great blessing to serve among the young missionaries and the senior missionaries. We have learned so much about the inner workings of the mission and how many sacrifices are made to do the Lord’s work here in this area, and also throughout the world.\nI would not have guessed that we would be serving a mission in our home region if you had asked me several years ago. But here we are, and we are loving this opportunity to serve the Lord in order to pay Him back for delivering us from our trials.\nOur prayers are with those in Ukraine at this time, and we know that the Lord will deliver them during these troubled and difficult times just as He did for my family in Korea. Though many Ukrainians are not of our faith, their faith has gotten them through the difficulties of war and they have declared that God sustains and supports them.\nAs the Lord declared, “Peace I give unto you.” He will bless us with peace and He will deliver us from our trials.\nIn Doctrine and Covenants Section 84, Verse 88, the Lord told the early Saints that He will send angels to us:\n\n“And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”\n\nIn closing:\nI know that the Lord Jesus Christ has power to deliver me from problems and troubles just like He did with the ancient Israelites. I know my Savior lives and loves me. I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe ship described by mom here was the LST class, Landing Ship Tank↩︎"

    "text": "At first significant snowstorm, each fall, my dad would look towards Timpanogos and ask,\n\n“Wonder where deers go for their food…”\n\nSince I didn’t know, I couldn’t answer so we moved on to a different topic.\nOur family lived in Provo for nearly 40 years.\nWe have hiked Rock Canyon as a family.\nAll of my children graduated from Rock Canyon Elementary.\nThis is our neighborhood and we know all there is to know about it.\nThat was an incorrect reasoning.\nOne afternoon, after parking the car at the Rock Canyon Park, I started a hike up to the Bonneville Shoreline Trail.\nNoticed a truck with a scope pointed at a spot above the trail. My curiosity was piqued.\nI didn’t have to ask much, the man anticipated my queries and explained in detail about the feeding pattern, places to watch, best times to see.\nHe knew so much about the deer herd of Rock Canyon. He showed me when to look (during mealtime), where to look (30-40 feet above the trail), and what to look for (herd of deer).\nI had never seen a deer herd before meeting this man with a scope.\nSince meeting with and coaching from the man, I can’t avoid seeing the herd.\nOne day, during a snowstorm, I saw a group of deer, moving together on a well-defined path, along the south edge of the Squaw Peak, about 200 feet above where I was.\nSo what seemed like a rhetorical question by my dad, turned into a specific teaching moment for me about the survival of deer in the wintertime.\n(Perhaps my dad, who has passed away, was gently influencing the man with the scope to teach me a thing or two)\nSo in this life, it seems, that one can pose a question or raise an issue and others may solve it for us. Or one can jump in and try to find, not only the answer, but also implement the solution once found.\n\nAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:\n\n\n\n\nRock Canyon Deer Herd\n\n\n\nFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."

Only recently we learned that it is one of the traits of a PTSD – not being able to let go or escape certain events or trials.\nThought of his stay in Vietnam during the 1960s as a work-vacation.\nForgetting that nation was in a civil war.\nHe always mentioned it as a crucible and a mean God has chosen to free us from the worldly debt and introduce us to American culture and a gateway to finding the gospel.\nIf greatness is defined as being true to one’s responsibility, my father had it – in abundance.\nRecently, my mom, told me how proud he was of me.\nHe rarely expressed it in words, but I felt it growing up.\nEven now, I feel his love and guidance.\nI love you too, Dad."

Used to think, learn not to pretent, instead of learn how to pretend)\nWhile the hit singles were up-beat and dance-ready, the one that I recall and listen now is\nWe are all Alone\n\n\nOutside the rain begins And it may never end\nSo cry no more, on the shore a dream\nWill take us out to sea\nForevermore, forevermore\n\n\nClose your eyes and dream\nAnd you can be with me\n’Neath the waves, through the caves of hours\nGone, forgotten now\nWe’re all alone, we’re all alone\n\n\nClose the window, calm the light\nAnd it will be all right\nNo need to bother now\nLet it out, let it all begin\nLearn how to pretend\n\n\nOnce a story’s told It can’t help but grow old\nRoses do, lovers too, so cast Your seasons to the wind\nAnd hold me dear, oh, hold me dear\n\n\nClose the window, calm the light\nAnd it will be all right\nNo need to bother now\nLet it out, let it all begin\nAll’s forgotten now\nWe’re all alone, all alone\n\n\nClose the window, calm the light\nAnd it will be all right\nNo need to bother now Let it out, let it all begin\nOwe it to the wind, my love, hold me dear\n\n\nAll’s forgotten now, my love\nWe’re all alone\n\n\nBoz Scaggs - 1976"

    "text": "For the last 12 years of her life, my mother lived in a white brickhouse.\n\nThe house was built on a slight slope, so that the east side of the house sat higher than the west.\nIt also meant, front of the house had 7 stair steps, where as it took 14 stairs to get to the basement. The basement opens up to the ground level on the west side.\nFrom her kitchen, she could see the Y-Mountain. Mount Timpanogos can be seen from the living room.\nMother and Father would convert a yard with grass into a gardening area that produced vegetables year around, except for the winter.\n\nIt contradicted what I envisioned as a retired person. In fact, my mother farmed until the very last, worked during the season of growing.\n\nShe was very independent. She would not use a wheel chair, no walker and definitely no canes for her.\nHowever, during the last few months of her life, she could not negotiate those steps. In addition, the snowfall made it dangerous for her to walk to the curbside.\nOne option was for her to move downstairs. Basement had a direct access to outisde and the driveway, thus no stairs involved.\nHowever, she would miss the sunlight that main level provided, especially on those cold winter days.\nWe discussed further.\nThe thought of sending mother to an assisted living was never brought up, since the thought never crossed our minds. We were united in keeping our mother at her home.\nThen, my wife suggested the following.\n\n“…I will carry her on my back…”\n\nMy mother is a small person, but still carrying a person down a flight of stairs is no simple task. Not to mention going back up those same 14 steps while carrying a person on the back.\nIn a small measure, we were able to give back all that our parents provided over the years.\nPerhaps in a very small means, we were able to do unto others, things they are not able to do on their own."

The logic was to pay back to parents what they did when we were little. 3 years of raising us, therefore spend 3 years of caretaker by the grave.\nThis type of reasoning did not survive the modern Korean thinking.\nThe introduction of Christianity and perhaps the increased practice of cremation may have brought about the certain demise of this practice."

    "text": "Met the parents of my mission companion.\nThe meeting was the post General Conference Korean Fireside hosted by the Korean Ward located in the Orem Sunset Stake. 1260 S 400 W, Orem, UT 84058\nAs long as I can recall, Koreans have always met separately after the conclusion of the General Conference.\nI remember as a missionary, seeing a contingent from Korea addressing Korean Saints in the LA area. LA Olympic Korean Ward. 1209 S Manhattan Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90019\nAlso during the early 1980s, visitors would meet in the old 7th East Building. 2450 S 600 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84106\nAs the Korean Branch/Ward expanded during the last couple of decades, meetings have been held in various buildings in the Edgemont Area of Provo, as well as in Midvale. 8350 Jackson St, Midvale, UT 84047\nI don’t recall much of what was said by speakers in those gatherings. I do remember meeting old friends and meeting new acquaintances A warm feeling of being with fellow believers and hearing comforting words in language of my father and mother.\nAny other group would say 5 sessions and nearly 10 hours of gospel-centered messages would be sufficient.\nNot Koreans.\nThey want to hear directly from their leaders A statement of those principles in their native language. As well as soak up any and all Korea related news.\nAs a bonus, this year, an Area 70 from Japan attended. Elder Imai said, he found out that his ancestors were from Korea\nFormat and people attending has changed over the years. But there are few families and individuals that did not change over time\nMy mission companion, Elder Pak, was from North Ogden. He is the youngest of 6 children and the only son in the family.\nAlso met the husband of his oldest sister. 김상현. He mentioned that E. Pak is doing quite well as an orthopedic surgeon. Owns 2 hospitals and 2 homes in Buena Park and Huntington Beach. His daughter chimed in, “He is in Peru now, arranging a bike ride back to US”\nThought to myself, my companion has done real well.\nThen the daughter mentioned their mother has dementia and has moved in to help out.\nIf she hadn’t mentioned it, I would not have realized, since she recalled and we talked normally about past events.\nAs I talked to the father more, I realized he sounded a lot like my own father.\nSo I ventured and asked where he is from. He said, he has lived in Incheon but he is originally from 함경도 Hamkyung Do. Just few miles from my father’s hometown. (he lived about the same distance as Ogden to Provo).\nFor a few minutes, thought I was listening to my own father speaking. That unmistakable pattern or 사투리 (억양 抑揚 or intonation) that only North Koreans from 함경남도 (咸鏡南道) area can express..\nThank you Paks. Thank you Father.\n\n\n\nDad and 고모 [姑母] aunt"

    "text": "A friend lives in a town, 20 miles away. Situated nearly the height of Willis (Sears) Tower, above the valley.\nHe has lived there for nearly 30 years and we have known one another for nearly entire time.\nStill remember when he announced he had sold his home near BYU (Brigham Young University).\nCan’t remember much of subjects that were taught. But we became friends, as well as our wives and children got acquainted.\n Over the years, we had a chance to visit their home in the mountains.\nMarveled how they improved both the land and their home.\nWitnessed how they raised their children and at the same time taking care of their aging parents.\nSaw they were cared for with love. The arrangement afforded both living independently and be among their grandchildren. This was a life’s lesson to be cherished.\nRecall times when they would ‘camp’ out to get a great spot for the annual July 4th Parade.\nWe would show up the morning of the Parade and they took us in.\nConsequently, extended family members were able to see the Parade in comfort and up close\n\nAlso we took long road trips together.\n(nearly all road trips are long in the West)\nThrough Las Vegas as well as Cedar Breaks, at times.\nAnd making them even longer by going through seldom visited towns such as Alamo and Caliente, Nevada.\nIn Alamo, we visited Mr. and Mrs. Martin Cox who used to live near us.\n\nOnce, they invited our whole family, including my parents and my mother-in-law to Fort Bridger Rendezvous\n\nWe were treated to meals, scenes, and experiences that we could not have on our own.\nThank you Pat and Mike and the rest of the Reid Clan for sharing part of your life with our family.\nWe appreciate it very much."

    "text": "Three days from now we will celebrate the the most important birth in history some 2000 years ago to Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem.\nBut for me the the birth of the second most important person in my life occurred 91 years ago on this day to Clyde and Elva Carter in Orem, Utah.\nHer name is Carol Jean.\nThree months and twenty days ago she passed through the veil to return to her Heavenly Father.\nIt was her time to go but not my time to let her go.\nShe has left huge hole in my heart.\nI want to tell you some things about this beautiful feisty woman.\nShe was quiet but tough.\nShe had a very clear sense how she should live her life and once she made up her mind to do something she did it regardless of circumstances.\nHer son, David said of her\n\n“she had an unwavering belief in our potential to do whatever we set our mind to. I know her belief in me made a difference in my life.”\n\nAnd her belief in me made all the difference in my life and I’d like to tell you about it.\nI had grown up on a small farm in Washington state and had not taken college preparation courses in a high school but instead had taken courses to prepare me to go back to the farm.\nFollowing graduation I was working for a farmer harvesting sugar beets when the weather turned cold and froze the beets in the ground. Two of my friends returned from BYU for Christmas break and told me how nice it was at BYU.\nI decided I’d had enough trying to dig frozen beets out of the ground and put my clothes into a cardboard box and took a Greyhound bus to Provo.\nI didn’t plan to stay in school but thought that a few agriculture classes couldn’t hurt.\nI just wanted to get out of the cold.\nIt turned out that my two friends were renting rooms in Carol’s home In Provo and they introduced me to her.\nAt BYU of course I signed up for agriculture classes and Dr. Thomas Martin was my advisor.\nAt the end of the quarter I was in his microbiology class and at the end of it he said\n\n“Mr. Rawlins I would like to see you in my office”.\n\nBeing very shy and insecure I entered with trepidation wondering what I had done.\nHe said to me\n\n“Mr Rawlins I’ve been observing your work and next quarter I don’t think you should take any more agriculture classes. You can learn all that by reading books. I think you should take Math, Physics and Chemistry classes and go on and get your PhD”.\n\nI was completely shocked. This was the furthest thing from my mind.\nBy this time Carol and I were seeing each other occasionally and when I told her of this preposterous suggestion and that I thought Dr. Martin was out of his mind she did did not agree.\nShe had worked as a secretary for him and was aware of his success in helping students obtain advanced degrees.\nShe simply said\n\n“of course you should do it. You can accomplish anything so set your mind to do”.\n\nAnd she never wavered from her belief in my potential.\nWhen the PhD diploma was issued it had my name on it but she was responsible for a huge part of it.\nAs I have looked back I realize that without the confidence I had gained from Carol’s belief in me there would have been no PhD.\nI would not have returned to school and would have simply returned home and got some kind of a job. With my limited resources there is no question that I would not have been a successful farmer but would have probably ended up as a farm worker as many in my family had been.\nWhat a special woman she is.\nI literally owe my life to her.\nAnd it’s impossible to know how many lives like mine have been changed by her example of personal courage and an unwavering belief in their potential.\nWhat a blessing she has been to all us that have had the privilege of having her in our lives.\nOur last six months living in a senior living center have been wonderful.\nWith no external distractions and relatively good health we have spent all of our time doing things together and have grown very close.\nWhen Carol returned from rehab for her hip surgery where I could not spend the night we were so pleased to be able to be together.\nOn the morning a day before she died she rolled over and laid her head on my shoulder and said to me\n\n“I love you Stephen. We are a team. We are tough cookies and together we can handle anything life brings our way”.\n\nAnd with Carol’s example of strength and courage and the help and guidance of our Lord I know I will be able to handle whatever life brings to me including this temporary separation from her.\nSteve Rawlins\n\n\n\nCarol and Steve"

    "text": "At times a popular movie alters and captures the mindset and imagination of a whole generation – and beyond.  \nOne such movie, for my generation, was the Princess Bride, released in 1987.\nThe movie fulfilled a need of that time period by re-visiting tried and true movie making approaches – with a modern twist.\nAction-Romantic-Comedy, not necessarily in the order of importance, would be one classification of the movie.  But like all great movies, it created its own genre and became a source of Vulgate for years to come.\nBeyond its romance tinged plot, the witty dialogue won me over.\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/best-quotes-from-the-princess-bride-list-2017-9\n\n\nGrandpa: Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.\nButtercup: Farm boy, polish my horse’s saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.\nWestley: As you wish.\nGrandpa: “As you wish” was all he ever said to her.\nButtercup: Farm boy, fill these with water - please.\nWestley: As you wish.\nGrandpa: That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was saying “As you wish,” what he\nmeant was, “I love you.” And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back.\nButtercup: Farm boy ... fetch me that pitcher.\nWestley: As you wish.\n\n\nWhen a relationship is solid, growing, and nurturing, voices are subdued.\nAt times no sound is needed.\nFor \"As you wish\" can be conveyed, just as well, without words\nThe Lord God speaks in a still, small voice.\nWhen people are listening, following, obeying, no dramatic intervention is needed.\nIf not, 災難 (disasters), wars and rumors of war and captivity of nations and souls follow.\nPrincess Bride showed that the dialogues are just as important, perhaps more important than actions in movies – as the popularity of Korean Dramas have recently demonstrated."

Wilson’s father had to wait 40 years to find the answer.\nWhen my father passed away (Feb 1930 - May 2020) I wrote his life sketch.\nIt was posted on FB and Mark mentioned his father was born a week earlier and he too served in the Korean War.\nI thanked him for the sacrifice and Mark shared the story of how his father learned the meaning of his service in Korea.\nThank you, all those that have served the country, and in particular, during Korean conflict.\nFor preserving the freedom for the people of Korea.\n\nThank you for your gratitude! My dad died 20 years ago. He never talked about his experiences in South Korea. He refused to answer our questions, even when we asked him directly.\n\nAbout the only thing he would ever say was how much of a waste of men it was. He claimed he never understood why “kids” his age had to go so far away to kill people.\nBut, in 1992 my mother died. A year later my dad had remarried and came to DC to “see the sights” with my stepmother.\nI volunteered to be their tour guide! One day we were doing the Mall area, visiting the monuments.\nBack then, there was a small eatery near the base of the Washington monument. We went there for some lunch.\n\nThe three of us sat at a small table in the back. A few minutes later an Asian kid asked if he could join us!\nMy dad started asking him questions. He was 18 years old and from Busan, South Korea, and was touring the United States.\nMy dad said, “Oh, I’ve been to Busan, but it is probably in a lot better shape today!”.\nThen the kid asked my dad some questions about my dad’s experience South Korea, which, surprisingly he answered (this is how I now know my dad was in Busan and Inchon)!\nThe kid eventually finished his lunch, asked my dad if he could be excused, and took his trash to the garbage can.\nThen he came back!?\nHe stood in front of my dad at attention and saluted him!\nHe said something like, “Sir, I want to thank you and your fellow countrymen for coming to the aid of my country so many years ago. Because of your sacrifices, people like me could grow up in freedom!”.\nAnd, poof! he was gone, lost in the crowds before any of us could say anything.\nWhen I looked at my dad, there was a tear rolling down his face. After a few minutes, he mumbled something like, “So, that is why we go!!!”. And, after that he never complained about going “so far away”. He still wouldn’t answer any questions us kids had, but lunch that day at the base of the Washington monument changed his outlook on life…and his war.\nSo, it is in this light, I thank you David Kang, for expressing your gratitude! I’m sure, if my dad was alive today, your gratitude would bring another tear to his cheek!!!"
