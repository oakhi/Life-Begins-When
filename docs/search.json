    "text": "Snowstorms before Christmas brings memories of years past, as a student — and a father.\nJune and I had 2 children before graduating from school.\nAround Halloween, we brought our 2nd child, a son, home to a 500 square foot apartment.\nIt was snowing.\nOur daughter welcomed home her brother and played with a doll with black hair like her.\nI should have been worried, no terrified, about finishing school. Also obtaining a job that would pay sufficiently.\nJune directed and took care of matters so that I can focus on school tasks and worry less about the future.\nRecently, have learned the steps she had to take to live on a student budget. We cut out even necessary things to get by.\nOne of the few entertainment options was a video/pizza place on Canyon Road.\nFor a couple of bucks, one can order a plain pizza and rent a videocassette movie.\nGlad that we didn’t have internet and social media those days.\nIt forced me to stay in school and work with others to get the work done.\nAlso, there were no distractions on what other people were making or doing.\nBecause of her effort, and some family support, I was able to complete school and find a job. I was happy to have job, not too concerned about the salary. It was another 7 years before my salary matched our needs.\nEven now, I recall how she encouraged and comforted me and made sure that home was welcoming and had freshly prepared meal ready. Because of it I didn’t know how desperate the situation and bleak the future really was.\nNow, those 2 children are raising a family of their own.\nThey are supporting one another and establishing a home of their own.\n\n\n\nDecember Sunset"

    "text": "Talk given at Seneca Stake, Spring 2022\nHello brothers and sisters,\nMy topic today is Jesus Christ is my Deliverer, which is taken from Come Follow Me, Exodus Chapters One to Two.\nThere are many ways the Lord can deliver His children from the challenges in life.\nWhen the ancient Israelites were in Egypt, they faced huge hardships.\nThey were slaves.\nThey were forced to do hard labor.\nThey had no hope for a better life.\nSo what did they do?\nIn Exodus Chapter 2, Verse 23, it reads,\n\n“They cried … unto God” for help.\n\nAnd the Lord answered their prayers.\nHe remembered His covenant people and sent Moses to help free them.\nMoses was a tool to guide the children of Israel to the Promised Land. Through Moses, who received authority from the Lord to act as His prophet, there were many miracles.\nThere is the story of Moses parting of the Red Sea to escape the Egyptians.\nThere is also the story of the people of Israel receiving manna, or bread, from heaven.\nThe Lord also told Moses to split a rock to provide water to the people in the desert, which Moses did.\nAll these miracles happened along the people of Israel’s journey back to the Promised Land.\nThe Lord physically and spiritually sustained them.\nIn a very significant way, the Lord guided my family to the United States of America.\nIn Ether Chapter Two Verses 9 and 12, it reads that the Americas is “a land of promise” and a “choice land.”\nThe Lord delivers us from our struggles and bad situations.\nHow do I know this?\nBecause He delivered my mother from living under a communist regime.\nMy mother’s family were Christians for three generations, at the time, but they lived in fear in North Korea.\nUnder the government, the ultimate punishments for Christian worshippers were being sent to do time in a hard labor camp or the firing squad. She kept her faith by praying daily at night under a thick blanket.\nShe was like the people of Alma in the Book of Mormon, who prayed in their hearts to avoid punishment from their enemies. He heard my mother’s prayers and I know that He answered her prayers.\nDuring the Korean War some seventy years ago, her family and other refugees were evacuated to a safer area in South Korea, thanks to the assistance from the United States Navy. 1\nWhile the war raged on, my mother and her family rarely lost hope and constantly prayed for the peace in the land. She saw miracles on many occasions, such as when the meager rations lasted longer than expected and also when her family received help from strangers, countless times.\nThe Lord delivered my mother’s family.\n\n\n\nMom, center 2nd row, attending a Protestant Church 1960s\n\n\nWhen my father was twenty years old, he was drafted into fighting for the South Korean Army during the Korean War. He was captured and tortured by the enemy on at least three different occasions.\nHowever, he managed to escape from his captors and reunited with his army unit each time. He told me countless times that he was led by the powerful impressions to know when and which direction to run during his escapes.\nOne time, after being captured, the enemy soldier told my father that he was “too young to die” and he was spared from execution.\nI am thankful to the Lord that He delivered my father from certain death.\n\n\n\nFather during the late 1950s\n\n\nHaving seen the horrors of war first-hand, my parents decided to emigrate to the U.S.\nThe Lord can deliver our family from difficult situations by inspiring a way to escape, in this case, emigrate to the chosen land.\nMy family has been blessed to be in this country and to be members of the Lord’s restored and true Church.\nAll of my children have served missions for the Church in Southern California and South Korea.\nMy nephews and niece have also served missions in New York City, Washington State, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan.\nDon and I are serving in the Washington, D.C. North Mission.\nIt has been a great blessing to serve among the young missionaries and the senior missionaries. We have learned so much about the inner workings of the mission and how many sacrifices are made to do the Lord’s work here in this area, and also throughout the world.\nI would not have guessed that we would be serving a mission in our home region if you had asked me several years ago. But here we are, and we are loving this opportunity to serve the Lord in order to pay Him back for delivering us from our trials.\nOur prayers are with those in Ukraine at this time, and we know that the Lord will deliver them during these troubled and difficult times just as He did for my family in Korea. Though many Ukrainians are not of our faith, their faith has gotten them through the difficulties of war and they have declared that God sustains and supports them.\nAs the Lord declared, “Peace I give unto you.” He will bless us with peace and He will deliver us from our trials.\nIn Doctrine and Covenants Section 84, Verse 88, the Lord told the early Saints that He will send angels to us:\n\n“And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”\n\nIn closing:\nI know that the Lord Jesus Christ has power to deliver me from problems and troubles just like He did with the ancient Israelites. I know my Savior lives and loves me. I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe ship described by mom here was the LST class, Landing Ship Tank↩︎"

    "text": "At first significant snowstorm, each fall, my dad would look towards Timpanogos and ask,\n\n“Wonder where deers go for their food…”\n\nSince I didn’t know, I couldn’t answer so we moved on to a different topic.\nOur family lived in Provo for nearly 40 years.\nWe have hiked Rock Canyon as a family.\nAll of my children graduated from Rock Canyon Elementary.\nThis is our neighborhood and we know all there is to know about it.\nThat was an incorrect reasoning.\nOne afternoon, after parking the car at the Rock Canyon Park, I started a hike up to the Bonneville Shoreline Trail.\nNoticed a truck with a scope pointed at a spot above the trail. My curiosity was piqued.\nI didn’t have to ask much, the man anticipated my queries and explained in detail about the feeding pattern, places to watch, best times to see.\nHe knew so much about the deer herd of Rock Canyon. He showed me when to look (during mealtime), where to look (30-40 feet above the trail), and what to look for (herd of deer).\nI had never seen a deer herd before meeting this man with a scope.\nSince meeting with and coaching from the man, I can’t avoid seeing the herd.\nOne day, during a snowstorm, I saw a group of deer, moving together on a well-defined path, along the south edge of the Squaw Peak, about 200 feet above where I was.\nSo what seemed like a rhetorical question by my dad, turned into a specific teaching moment for me about the survival of deer in the wintertime.\n(Perhaps my dad, who has passed away, was gently influencing the man with the scope to teach me a thing or two)\nSo in this life, it seems, that one can pose a question or raise an issue and others may solve it for us. Or one can jump in and try to find, not only the answer, but also implement the solution once found.\n\nAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:\n\n\n\n\nRock Canyon Deer Herd\n\n\n\nFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."

Only recently we learned that it is one of the traits of a PTSD – not being able to let go or escape certain events or trials.\nThought of his stay in Vietnam during the 1960s as a work-vacation.\nForgetting that nation was in a civil war.\nHe always mentioned it as a crucible and a mean God has chosen to free us from the worldly debt and introduce us to American culture and a gateway to finding the gospel.\nIf greatness is defined as being true to one’s responsibility, my father had it – in abundance.\nRecently, my mom, told me how proud he was of me.\nHe rarely expressed it in words, but I felt it growing up.\nEven now, I feel his love and guidance.\nI love you too, Dad."

(Husband of the aunt was killed in an industrial accident and she had become a minister in a church)\nBut grandma Kim objected and insisted that her oldest daughter stay with her. As a compromise, the second oldest went to stay with the aunt. However, the bombing of roads and bridges meant that she couldn’t get back in time to join the family.\nMy aunt, Hyunsook 현숙, was left behind. And we don’t know whether she is still living.\nThe last contact was over 70 years ago.\n\n\n\nSurviving Hwang Sisters\n\n\n\n아~~ 꽃필 때나 오시려느냐\n\n\n아~~~~ 눈올 때나 오시려느냐\n\n\n보따리 등에 메고 넘던 고개길\n\n\n산새도 나와 함께 울고 넘었지\n\n\n자유여 너를 위해 자유여 너를 위해\n\n\n이 목숨을 바친다\n\nWill you return when flowers bloom\nOr when snow covers fields\nRecall when we escaped with essentials on our back\nEven birds sang mournfully through mountain passages\nFreedom, I re-dedicate my life"

My uncle commented,\n\n“why is it that everyone is emphasizing dancing over singing…”\n\n(I should have put my money on those talent agencies that cater to dancers.)\nOne element of Korean songs is a feeling of resentment; deep sorrow: A feeling of bitterness, deep resentment or sorrow that builds up in one’s mind from an unfair or regretful event.\nDidn’t fully realize these singers are singing more than just songs but a longing or yearning for a place, time, or a person they once met but no longer able to.\nIn essence, trot songs are K-Drama presented in a 5 minute segment. Feelings, aspirations, and disappoints of each generation.\nWithin that longing lies a hope that one day will be realized. Until then, my generation will sing those songs not found on Spotify."

Communists gathered religious leaders and they were to face death as a group.\nThe uncle fell and pretended to be dead before the bullets hit the prisoners.\nAs other prisoners fell by the bullet, they wound up on top of him. He thought he had escaped death, until the bayonet check almost cost him his life.\n\n\n\nA Presbyterian Congregation in Incheon\n\n\nAfter 20 years of participating in Presbyterian faith, my mom, as her family before, was still searching.\nMy father met missionaries as they were street contacting in Incheon.\nMy mother had many questions that were answered by missionaries, a visit by Elder Harold B.

One was the Bible and the other was the Book of Mormon A hand was also shown and as the hand was waved between 2 books, a voice was overheard.\n\nThese 2 books are equivalent\n\nAll these experiences along with her faith enabled to accept the gospel as thought by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latte-Day Saints.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nKIM Han-sik, ‘The Influence of Christianity’, Korean Journal XXIII, 12, December 1983, p. 5.↩︎"

    "text": "Three days from now we will celebrate the the most important birth in history some 2000 years ago to Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem.\nBut for me the the birth of the second most important person in my life occurred 91 years ago on this day to Clyde and Elva Carter in Orem, Utah.\nHer name is Carol Jean.\nThree months and twenty days ago she passed through the veil to return to her Heavenly Father.\nIt was her time to go but not my time to let her go.\nShe has left huge hole in my heart.\nI want to tell you some things about this beautiful feisty woman.\nShe was quiet but tough.\nShe had a very clear sense how she should live her life and once she made up her mind to do something she did it regardless of circumstances.\nHer son, David said of her\n\n“she had an unwavering belief in our potential to do whatever we set our mind to. I know her belief in me made a difference in my life.”\n\nAnd her belief in me made all the difference in my life and I’d like to tell you about it.\nI had grown up on a small farm in Washington state and had not taken college preparation courses in a high school but instead had taken courses to prepare me to go back to the farm.\nFollowing graduation I was working for a farmer harvesting sugar beets when the weather turned cold and froze the beets in the ground. Two of my friends returned from BYU for Christmas break and told me how nice it was at BYU.\nI decided I’d had enough trying to dig frozen beets out of the ground and put my clothes into a cardboard box and took a Greyhound bus to Provo.\nI didn’t plan to stay in school but thought that a few agriculture classes couldn’t hurt.\nI just wanted to get out of the cold.\nIt turned out that my two friends were renting rooms in Carol’s home In Provo and they introduced me to her.\nAt BYU of course I signed up for agriculture classes and Dr. Thomas Martin was my advisor.\nAt the end of the quarter I was in his microbiology class and at the end of it he said\n\n“Mr. Rawlins I would like to see you in my office”.\n\nBeing very shy and insecure I entered with trepidation wondering what I had done.\nHe said to me\n\n“Mr Rawlins I’ve been observing your work and next quarter I don’t think you should take any more agriculture classes. You can learn all that by reading books. I think you should take Math, Physics and Chemistry classes and go on and get your PhD”.\n\nI was completely shocked. This was the furthest thing from my mind.\nBy this time Carol and I were seeing each other occasionally and when I told her of this preposterous suggestion and that I thought Dr. Martin was out of his mind she did did not agree.\nShe had worked as a secretary for him and was aware of his success in helping students obtain advanced degrees.\nShe simply said\n\n“of course you should do it. You can accomplish anything so set your mind to do”.\n\nAnd she never wavered from her belief in my potential.\nWhen the PhD diploma was issued it had my name on it but she was responsible for a huge part of it.\nAs I have looked back I realize that without the confidence I had gained from Carol’s belief in me there would have been no PhD.\nI would not have returned to school and would have simply returned home and got some kind of a job. With my limited resources there is no question that I would not have been a successful farmer but would have probably ended up as a farm worker as many in my family had been.\nWhat a special woman she is.\nI literally owe my life to her.\nAnd it’s impossible to know how many lives like mine have been changed by her example of personal courage and an unwavering belief in their potential.\nWhat a blessing she has been to all us that have had the privilege of having her in our lives.\nOur last six months living in a senior living center have been wonderful.\nWith no external distractions and relatively good health we have spent all of our time doing things together and have grown very close.\nWhen Carol returned from rehab for her hip surgery where I could not spend the night we were so pleased to be able to be together.\nOn the morning a day before she died she rolled over and laid her head on my shoulder and said to me\n\n“I love you Stephen. We are a team. We are tough cookies and together we can handle anything life brings our way”.\n\nAnd with Carol’s example of strength and courage and the help and guidance of our Lord I know I will be able to handle whatever life brings to me including this temporary separation from her.\nSteve Rawlins\n\n\n\nCarol and Steve"

    "text": "At times a popular movie alters and captures the mindset and imagination of a whole generation – and beyond.  \nOne such movie, for my generation, was the Princess Bride, released in 1987.\nThe movie fulfilled a need of that time period by re-visiting tried and true movie making approaches – with a modern twist.\nAction-Romantic-Comedy, not necessarily in the order of importance, would be one classification of the movie.  But like all great movies, it created its own genre and became a source of Vulgate for years to come.\nBeyond its romance tinged plot, the witty dialogue won me over.\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/best-quotes-from-the-princess-bride-list-2017-9\n\n\nGrandpa: Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.\nButtercup: Farm boy, polish my horse’s saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.\nWestley: As you wish.\nGrandpa: “As you wish” was all he ever said to her.\nButtercup: Farm boy, fill these with water - please.\nWestley: As you wish.\nGrandpa: That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was saying “As you wish,” what he\nmeant was, “I love you.” And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back.\nButtercup: Farm boy ... fetch me that pitcher.\nWestley: As you wish.\n\n\nWhen a relationship is solid, growing, and nurturing, voices are subdued.\nAt times no sound is needed.\nFor \"As you wish\" can be conveyed, just as well, without words\nThe Lord God speaks in a still, small voice.\nWhen people are listening, following, obeying, no dramatic intervention is needed.\nIf not, 災難 (disasters), wars and rumors of war and captivity of nations and souls follow.\nPrincess Bride showed that the dialogues are just as important, perhaps more important than actions in movies – as the popularity of Korean Dramas have recently demonstrated."

    "text": "My mother will be coming home in a few days.\nShe has been in the Utah Valley Hospital and Provo Rehabilitation & Nursing since November 10th.\nGrateful to dedicated workers, technology, and the grace of God.\nFor unknown reasons, her right arm began to swell and changed colors – to purple.\nWorkers performed blood tests, administered IV and blood transfusion and managed her pain.\nDoctors at the hospital determined that acute symptoms have abated and discharged her to the rehabilitation facility across the street, to recover and to return home.\nBut her arm didn’t get better.\nAlthough Rehab facility personnel tried their best with their given resources, my mom’s pain and the swelling increased.\nAs a last resort, her daughter-in-law pleaded with administrators to send her back to the hospital for evaluations – to find the cause.\nA nurse from the radiology admission area came to take mom to the CT (computer tomography) Scan area.\nWhen the nurse saw the condition of the arm, she changed the directive and wheeled my mom to the emergency area.\nBecause of the action of that nurse, mom was able to get both the CT Scan and the Ultrasound of her arm and increased attention on pain management.\nThe evaluations showed that there was a pseudo-aneurysm in her artery near the fistula.\nThe solution was to inject Thrombin into the area that was leaking blood.\nThe surgery was performed on the day before Thanksgiving.\nIt was successful and mom avoided more invasive surgery.\nNow she can begin the 4-week recovery.\nThankful to be living in a time and place that has access to the latest medical advancements. To live among men and women with the knowledge and practice medicine with wisdom.\nTo those men and women that responded and answered the prayer and pleading of the daughter-in-law and shewed mercy and was a neighbor to strangers - thank you."

They are superheroes that we can always count on.\nThey are our parents.\nOne of the challenges of this life is to see our heroes fade away.\nMany in my parents’ generation experienced wars, colonial occupation, famine, torn families, political and economic upheavals, street demonstrations that led to democratic reforms and eventual economic miracle.\nIn particular, my parents had to re-start their lives in 2 different countries – as refugees and immigrants.\nOnce as refugees of a war, from their home in North Korea to South Korea in their teenage years.\nNext as a searching for better economic outcome immigrant to United States in their 40s\nI don’t recall all the individual lessons of my parents.\nI do remember their calm approach to life.\nBecause of their experiences with people, events, and challenges that they had to overcome, growing up, I never saw them panic.\nThey would analyze the situation, draw upon their collective experiences, then formulate a plan to deal with it.  \nIf the burden seemed too heavy, they called on the help from above.\nTheir, not so secret, arsenal was their faith in God.\nBoth of them lived their lives in accordance with this Christian principles,\nTherefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\nAs my wife and I are assuming the role of that generation.\nWe are not prepared for that role and are scared about the future.\nHowever, these things give us hope\nStrength and tender care and love our parents demonstrated.\nA certain knowledge that God is with us.\nWatching and associating with the people of this rising generation.\nThis generation that knows far more than we ever imagined at their age.\nThis generation that is not afraid to tackle tasks, considered too difficult in generations past.\nThank you Mom and Dad, we can count on this new generation of superheroes."

    "text": "“Sir, I want to thank you and your fellow countrymen\nfor coming to the aid of my country so many years ago.\nBecause of your sacrifices, people like me could grow up in freedom!”.\nMy father knew the reason for the war.\nMark A. Wilson’s father had to wait 40 years to find the answer.\nWhen my father passed away (Feb 1930 - May 2020) I wrote his life sketch.\nIt was posted on FB and Mark mentioned his father was born a week earlier and he too served in the Korean War.\nI thanked him for the sacrifice and Mark shared the story of how his father learned the meaning of his service in Korea.\nThank you, all those that have served the country, and in particular, during Korean conflict.\nFor preserving the freedom for the people of Korea.\n\nThank you for your gratitude! My dad died 20 years ago. He never talked about his experiences in South Korea. He refused to answer our questions, even when we asked him directly.\n\nAbout the only thing he would ever say was how much of a waste of men it was. He claimed he never understood why “kids” his age had to go so far away to kill people.\nBut, in 1992 my mother died. A year later my dad had remarried and came to DC to “see the sights” with my stepmother.\nI volunteered to be their tour guide! One day we were doing the Mall area, visiting the monuments.\nBack then, there was a small eatery near the base of the Washington monument. We went there for some lunch.\n\nThe three of us sat at a small table in the back. A few minutes later an Asian kid asked if he could join us!\nMy dad started asking him questions. He was 18 years old and from Busan, South Korea, and was touring the United States.\nMy dad said, “Oh, I’ve been to Busan, but it is probably in a lot better shape today!”.\nThen the kid asked my dad some questions about my dad’s experience South Korea, which, surprisingly he answered (this is how I now know my dad was in Busan and Inchon)!\nThe kid eventually finished his lunch, asked my dad if he could be excused, and took his trash to the garbage can.\nThen he came back!?\nHe stood in front of my dad at attention and saluted him!\nHe said something like, “Sir, I want to thank you and your fellow countrymen for coming to the aid of my country so many years ago. Because of your sacrifices, people like me could grow up in freedom!”.\nAnd, poof! he was gone, lost in the crowds before any of us could say anything.\nWhen I looked at my dad, there was a tear rolling down his face. After a few minutes, he mumbled something like, “So, that is why we go!!!”. And, after that he never complained about going “so far away”. He still wouldn’t answer any questions us kids had, but lunch that day at the base of the Washington monument changed his outlook on life…and his war.\nSo, it is in this light, I thank you David Kang, for expressing your gratitude! I’m sure, if my dad was alive today, your gratitude would bring another tear to his cheek!!!"
