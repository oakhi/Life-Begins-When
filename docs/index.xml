  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>My mother was an avid consumer of all things from and about Korea - that included Korean Popular Entertainment. I believe that eased her longing for both Koreas, North and South.</p>
<p>She would watch the daily KBS News, and also keep up to date on popular celebrities, (연예인, 탤런트) or singers.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230530 Reunite/main.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I remember, growing up, she would rent a dozen or so VHS tapes to view her favorite series, 연속극(連續劇)</p>
<p>Although I watched few episodes of Jewel in the Palace (대장금/大長今) and Moon Embracing the Sun (해를 품은 달) I resisted her invitation to watch those programs with her since it took a considerable time and commitment.</p>
<p>And I also knew they were well written and acted and their period customs were both accurate and well made.</p>
<p>So I avoided watching them, knowing how addictive they were.</p>
<p>My standard reply was,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I am already involved in a real life Korean-drama in this family.</p>
<p>Why do I want to watch another on TV?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She knew more about the Korean entertainment scene than most people one-half or one-forth her age.</p>
<p>And her enthusiasm for the Korean Wave preceded the general public by a decade or two</p>
<p>However, when she moved to Utah in her late 70s, she lost her network of friends who kept her updated and who used to share those DVDs and VHSs and her access to her familiar or go-to Korean TV channels and programs, available via the Dish TV.</p>
<p>She never got adjusted to internet-based programming.</p>
<p>My son got her the Google TV and that helped her with YouTube and other offerings.</p>
<p>Then she and I began hearing about a drama from friends in far away places and subsequently read up on a world-wide phenomenon, known as CLoY, Crash Landing on You (사랑의 불시착).</p>
<p>Before I knew about the story line, my wife informed me that the leading character was someone she liked based on <code>Secret Garden</code> series</p>
<p>I knew Ms.&nbsp;Son from the movie, <code>Classics</code>.</p>
<p>The story line, set in today’s Korea dealt with defectors crossing DMZ back and forth - a dream for those from the North.</p>
<p>This sounded like a must-see Korean Drama.</p>
<hr>
<p>So my mom and I started watching the series together.</p>
<p>Fell immediately for the characters, especially those depicting villagers in North Korea and Korean People’s Army (조선인민군), in addition to leading characters.</p>
<p>For those supporting cast members spoke just like my mom and dad, my uncles and aunts, with the Northern Accent.</p>
<p>My extended family, when they gather, they subconsciously let go of decades-long practice of using the Southern Accent.</p>
<p>Endearing me further was the scene and practices of a life in North Korea, that was closer to the Korea I grew up in the 60s and 70s.</p>
<p>The black market scene brought back memories of those days when everything seemed to be in short supply and beyond the affordability of most people.</p>
<p>Whenever I go back to Korea, I am taken back by the growth and affluence.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I feel like I am from a developing country.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to be a well dressed model and have jumped out of magazines or they can readily jump into a Korean Drama or a number of “Korea’s Got Talent” like shows.</p>
<p>It was a rare treat to see North Koreans depicted with care and accuracy that made me feel that there were distant cousins and other family members that I may meet in the future.</p>
<p>And that there may be a few areas in common that we can begin the conversation.</p>
<p>My mom and I finished the series in a matter of days, often viewing 2 to 3 episodes at a time.</p>
<p>For a brief time, the series took us to another place and time and brought us a hope for possible unification and a chance to unite as a family.</p>
<hr>
<p>That was two years ago.</p>
<p>Now that my parents have departed this life, there is little to no prospect of uniting with my parents’ family in North Korea.</p>
<p>Even if the boundaries were opened tomorrow and we could travel to the hometown or ancestral homes of my parents, would the Kang/Hwang family still be there?</p>
<p>By miracle that we were able to locate the family, how would we begin the conversation?</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you make up for 73 years of no communications?</li>
<li>Are there any areas of common understanding?</li>
<li>How would writers of Korean Dramas write the script for this kind of reunion?</li>
</ul>
<p>I have an uncle, my dad’s youngest brother, in his 80s.</p>
<p>He is the last link, on the Kang side, with North Korea.</p>

</div>
<p>My mother has one more sister in North Korea, she is 1.5 years younger than my mother.</p>
<p>She may still be alive, but there has been no confirmation of her whereabouts for nearly 75 years.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>Crash Landing on You</code> romanticized the 2 sides of a nation still at war.</p>
<p>Providing a momentary glimpse and a hope that the separated family may once again be united.</p>
<p>With each passing year, the generation that experienced the Korean War is dwindling.</p>
<p>Those that experienced the lasting effect of war, poverty, death and separation of family are aging quickly.</p>
<p>I do not know if unification will ever take place in the peninsula of Korea.</p>
<p>Even if it did, I don’t how the families will be reunited and reacquainted.</p>
<p>Even for the writers of CLoY, it would be a challenge to write scripts for these improbable re-unions</p>
<p>Although it is highly unlikely, I will pray for divine intervention to take place in my lifetime.</p>
<p>For, If any nation or people can pull this off, it is the people of Korea, both North and South.</p>
<p>They have demonstrated their hard work, post Korean War.</p>

<p>They created and experienced the economic miracles that started during the 70s and 80s.</p>

<p><em>God Almighty, through thy servants, thou hast revealed the truth to the people of Korea, a little by little.</em></p>
<p><em>Thou hast also rescued and preserved this country, called Korea, numerous times.</em></p>
<p><em>Will thou hasten the restoration of that nation once more, as one, under God.</em></p>
<p><em>That we may once again call one another brothers and sisters, which we are.</em></p>
<p><em>Wilt thou move the hearts and minds of leaders of 2 Koreas and those nations that have controlling interest in Korea.</em></p>
<p><em>Pray that the unification can take place in my lifetime.</em></p>
<p><em>If it is not thy will currently, will thou reveal steps, send dedicated people, and name sacrifices necessary for the unification to occur in my lifetime or in my children’s lifetime.</em></p>
<p>Pleading on behalf of my parents’ generation and also for the rising generation.</p>
<p>Gratefully,</p>
<p>A son of North Korean Parents May 2023</p>

  <title>Live Like a Refugee</title>
  <dc:creator>DK</dc:creator>
  <link>https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230529 A Refugee/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>During my high school years Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers had a hit song called <code>Refugee</code>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Somewhere, somehow, somebody must have kicked you around some…<br>
Honey, it don’t really matter to me, baby<br>
Everybody’s had to fight to be free…<br>
You don’t have to live like a refugee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of my high school friends used to tease me.<br>
Saying,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Why do you have to live like a refugee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought it didn’t bother me,</p>
<p>But I obviously remembered it, so it must have had its intended impact and affected my psyche – after all these years.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230529 A Refugee/main.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The simple answer is that I lived like a refugee, because for all intents and purposes, our family was an economic or opportunity seeking refugees from South Korea that moved to America.</p>
<p>Officially, our family came to the United States on an Employment-Based Immigrant Visa<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In some sense, we can be further categorized as economic, political or war time refugees from North Korea.</p>
<p>Since my parents move out of North Korea.</p>
<p>My father’s family moved to South Korea for better opportunities.</p>
<p>My mother’s family escaped North Korea after enduring communist take over of once promising agricultural and commercial ownership</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>However the response may include contemplation of the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>From what were we running away.</li>
<li>To what were we running to.</li>
<li>What was our refuge?</li>
<li>Where was that refuge?</li>
<li>Are we still running?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on those review questions, as my High School friends correctly observed, I have lived like a refugee, currently live a refugee-like life.</p>
<p>I will probably live in the future as one.</p>
<p>Until I find contentment, or that place or time that I have been seeking</p>
<p>[Or continue to run away from and to live separately].</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Is it possible to achieve refugee-free life - in this life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers are all seeking the same – peace based on acquisition of place, wealth, and relationships.</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Note, my mom’s actual birth year is 1932, records were altered after the War</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>When life presents its many challenges and questions, my parents’ life provide a hint, a glimpse, a path.</p>
<p>They saved, worked, and believed like they were constantly building a new and better life.</p>
<p>We always had life’s essentials, even when we lived in a small apartment. Rice, water, soy sauce and emergency provisions</p>
<p>Their life was centered around work. They didn’t stop until last few years of their lives.</p>
<p>They were fiercely independent in thoughts or ideals.</p>
<p>A discussion on relative merits of different forms of government was a non-starter.</p>
<p>For them there was only one, the one that guarantees the opportunity or freedom of and for its people.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230529 A Refugee/june.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I never fully understood their way of living nor was I, at times, proud to be part of the family.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind, they did their best to give us a safe, god-fearing, kind to others life.</p>
<p>They give me strength and hope that I will ultimately arrive at the refuge that I have been seeking.</p>
<p>Mom and Dad, thank you.</p>

  <title>Gathered to his Fathers</title>

<p>Like many immigrants before him, he was not gathered to his fathers physically, when he passed away 3 years ago.</p>
<p>It is longing of nearly all people, to buried like Biblical Patriarchs.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>But he was gathered to the place and to the people he associated with and cherished for most of his adult life.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230528 Memorial Day/main.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>My father lived first 44 years of his life in Korea. Then he spent the next 46 years in America</p>
<p>For the vast majority of his adult life he had contact with the American people and their institutions, its values and economic system and the ideal of freedom.</p>
<p>His maternal uncle sought him and and the family, often walking along the 120 mile journey from Seoul to their home in Hamkyung do.</p>
<p>He made it to Southern Korea before the War.</p>
<p>He most likely would have perished in the Korean War had he fought on the North Korean side.</p>
<p>His fate altered, he was a trained army personnel fighting alongside United Nations forces, and its chief sponsor, the United States of America</p>
<p>Like many young, poor people of his generation, some of the tenets of Communism appealed to him.</p>
<p>An abolition of class through revolution and the promise</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>to abolish private ownership of the means of production, advocating for collective ownership and control</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230528 Memorial Day/dad.JPG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>However when he witnessed the outcome of socialism or communism his mind was changed</p>
<p>He fought North Koreans in battles and saw their dead and how utterly ill-prepared they were for the fight.</p>
<p>He was furious that the young people were dying to prove some theories that they neither understood nor would have supported if given a choice.</p>
<p>He became, in essence, a born-again anti-communist, a supporter of freedom from tyranny of communism</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230528 Memorial Day/crane.JPG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>After the war, he secured a job with the remaining American forces, a 미군부대, 美軍部隊.</p>
<p>Learning a skill that would serve him well.</p>
<p>He would go on to work in and in Vietnam, where he was able to understand better the traits of American people.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230528 Memorial Day/chevy.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>He returned home in 1970 but he didn’t stay very long. He moved to Maryland, on April, 1974</p>
<p>During those 4 years in Korea, he met missionaries, invited them home and my family was baptized in May of 1971</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230528 Memorial Day/letter.JPG" class="img-fluid"> He died the morning of Tuesday, a week before Memorial Day.</p>
<p>The cemetery said, the weekend burial would be nearly impossible due to the expected Memorial Day crowd.</p>
<p>Then they suggested a remote possibility of a Friday graveside service.</p>
<p>He was interned on Friday, May 22nd.</p>
<p>Next day, the whole cemetery was filled with flags and flowers.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230528 Memorial Day/cemetery.JPG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For a patriotic soldier, it was a loving welcome from the adopted country.</p>
<p>And a fitting goodbye for an immigrant family, originally from a small village in Northern Korea.</p>
<p>Someday, when the man-made and man-upheld boundaries are no longer, I hope to seek out records of fathers and mothers of past generations and their descendants and have another memorial service on behalf of my parents in North Korea.</p>

  <title>Decades of Travels</title>

<p>Received a new passport, issued by the United States Department of State.</p>
<p>It took twice as long to renew, about 10 weeks, roughly a monthly apartment rent, when I was a newly-wed back in the 1990s.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230522 passport travel/flower.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<section id="first-passport-jul-1990---jul-2000" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-passport-jul-1990---jul-2000">First Passport : Jul 1990 - Jul 2000</h2>
<p>Hardly used the first.</p>
<p>From 1974 till 1990, I never traveled outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Then after marrying June, we went to Korea to report our marriage to June’s family. Her family traces her lineage back for nearly thousand years and they are majority owner in a village next to 현충사(顯忠祠)<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>However, my side of the family, because most family members still live in North Korea, we can count on 2 hands, those that are directly related to us.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful month long visit to June’s hometown and her ancestral home.</p>
<p>I remember sleeping the main bedroom when we visited their old home. They graciously let us sleep in the most comfortable room and they slept in the guest room. I can still recall hearing the cicadas buzzing sound as we slept.</p>
<p>In addition, my family came to Korea to celebrate my dad’s 60th Birthday and my grandmother’s 80th Birthday.</p>
<p>Seeing all my families together, some I hadn’t seen in nearly 20 years, made me feel more homesick and I resolved that I would find a way to visit more often.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230522 passport travel/1990_family.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>But my desires for international travel didn’t materialize for a long time.</p>
<p>Then it happened.</p>
<p>In 1997, a trip to Suzhou, China was arranged.</p>
<p>It was a trip to plan an equipment transfer from Sandy, Utah to Suzhou, China plant. This was the beginning and it opened many more opportunities.</p>
<p>The company was expanding into Asia and I met people who travel to overseas, assess potential business acquisition and formulate strategies to integrate those company.</p>
<p>I wanted to be part of it.</p>
<p>Then a year later, a VP of World Wide Manufacturing calls me into his office.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Would you interested in moving to Korea with your family and work on integrating Korean manufacturers into the world wide group?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could have given my answer right then.</p>
<p>He suggested June and I traveled to Korea and see if this is something I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Then to bolster my confidence, he said as I left his office.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You are probably the only person on this earth capable of handling this role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting in the fall of 1998, I was using the passport on a monthly basis. Sometimes weekly, since the Asian Pacific HQ was in Singapore.</p>
<p>By May of 2000, 2 months prior to expiration date, I ran out of pages on the passport.</p>
</section>
<section id="nd-passport---may-2000---may-2010" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nd-passport---may-2000---may-2010">2nd Passport - May 2000 - May 2010</h2>
<p>Went to the United States Embassy in Seoul to renew the passport.</p>
<p>I was treated like a VIP and the passport was issued to me within hours.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230522 passport travel/passport2.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This time the booklet was much thicker, anticipating more work related travels to China, HK, Singapore, Japan, and even Europe.</p>
</section>
<section id="rd-passport---jun-2012---june-2022" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rd-passport---jun-2012---june-2022">3rd Passport - Jun 2012 - June 2022</h2>
<p>For nearly 5 years, from 2007 to 2012, there were no overseas travel.</p>
<p>However, to be ready, just in case, the passport was renewed.</p>
<p>Then a new role with a new company, I would travel to Japan several times a year.</p>
<p>This was not expected outcome but welcomed.</p>
<p>Appreciated and cherished the opportunity to travel to Asia again.</p>
</section>
<section id="renewed-appreciation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="renewed-appreciation">Renewed Appreciation</h2>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230522 passport travel/passport1.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Upon receiving the new passport, looked up the cost of traveling to some favorite locations.</p>
<p>Prices were roughly twice as much from recent traveling years.</p>
<p>Accrued airline mileages could only take me to Continental US locations.</p>
<p>Far cry from times when not only renewal costs but vast majority of travels to Asian and European destinations were paid for by the employer.</p>
<p>I may not travel and use my new passport.</p>
<p>However, I opted for the thicker booklet (52 pages) rather than the standard 28 pages. Just in case…</p>
<p>My son once said that it is hard to claim knowledge or understanding of a country that you are visiting as a tourist or on business.</p>
<p>Nevertheless traveling even if for a few weeks or days it is still far better than not traveling at all.</p>
<p>I regret that I did not prepare myself before traveling those locations.<br>
I may have gained far more understanding of the culture and history, had I tried.</p>
<p>So I will pay the necessary fees, prepare and wait on future opportunities to travel.</p>
<p>If not, then I will look back and reminisce about lessons learned and people I met, during past travels.</p>

  <title>Marriott Commencement</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Attending an 2-hour commencement ceremony, one can get through much reflections about the past and the future.</p>
<p>The 148th Commencement<sup>1</sup> was well executed, like a smooth running factory where everyone knew where they needed to be.</p>
<p>The speaker<sup>2</sup> said all the right things. The College Dean<sup>3</sup> was upbeat and beaming at times.</p>
<p>This was a pinnacle of capitalistic education</p>
<p>Each graduate had 10 to 15 seconds of fame. When their name was called and their accomplishment recognized.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230521 marriott commencement/20230428_194210-01.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Thought of the Marriott Family of Washington DC.</p>
<p>They have a school name after them. They also built a structure 50 years ago that houses, athletic events, devotionals, and graduations such as this.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What did J. Willard and Alice discuss when they launched their Hot Shoppes business shortly after they married?<br>
What led them to Washington DC?<br>
Did they ever doubt their decisions, how did they overcome their doubt?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They transitioned to a hospitality business 30 years later.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Did they envision a future as a billion dollar enterprise?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now nearly 100 years after they were married, Marriotts are blessing lives of thousands of individuals each year.</p>
<p>As my wife like to say,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hard to fathom the strength and accomplishment of 2 devoted, determined individuals that become one in purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My parents also attended the graduation in August of 1988.</p>
<p>Whereas I walked to this commencement from home in 2023, they drove over 2,000 miles to be there in 1988.</p>
<p>I can’t remember who the speaker was or whether I received diploma from the college dean that day</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230521 marriott commencement/mom_graduation.JPG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>But I do remember the journey the driving to Utah from Maryland in Oldsmobile Delta 88 diesel.</p>
<p>Will treasure days travelling to and from Utah and visiting with them.</p>
<p>I used to question why did they come all that way?</p>
<p>Recently I remembered that their education was cut short due to external circumstances, the Korean War, death of their father.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230521 marriott commencement/sean_dad.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>They came to celebrate not only their son’s graduation but seeing a fulfillment of their longstanding wishes and dreams.</p>
<p>Realized that unfulfilled dreams of past generations are worked on and completed by the current and future generations.</p>
<p>I mingled outside with other parents and grandparents watching little ones.</p>
<p>As I returned to watch the balance of my son’s graduation, I wondered,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>what kind of world his daughter and her generation would inherit and create.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More immediately,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What legacy are we leaving for my son’s generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>what dreams will be fulfilled by future generations</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What enterprises and dreams will be started and fulfilled by the children of this graduating class?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>How many Marriotts will there be in 25, 50 or even 100 years from now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230521 marriott commencement/sean_mom.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the distant future when my grandchildren graduates,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Will there be actual, in-person ceremonies? Will there be Universities, like the ones we know? Will I see them graduate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go Class of 2045 to 2050 !</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A friend lives in a town, 20 miles away. Situated nearly the height of Willis (Sears) Tower, above the valley.</p>
<p>He has lived there for nearly 30 years and we have known one another for nearly entire time.</p>
<p>Still remember when he announced he had sold his home near BYU (Brigham Young University).</p>
<p>Can’t remember much of subjects that were taught. But we became friends, as well as our wives and children got acquainted.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230426 30 year friendship/nebo.jpeg" class="img-fluid"> Over the years, we had a chance to visit their home in the mountains.<br>
Marveled how they improved both the land and their home.</p>
<p>Witnessed how they raised their children and at the same time taking care of their aging parents.<br>
Saw they were cared for with love. The arrangement afforded both living independently and be among their grandchildren. This was a life’s lesson to be cherished.</p>
<p>Recall times when they would ‘camp’ out to get a great spot for the annual July 4th Parade.<br>
We would show up the morning of the Parade and they took us in.<br>
Consequently, extended family members were able to see the Parade in comfort and up close</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230426 30 year friendship/cedar.JPG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Also we took long road trips together.<br>
(nearly all road trips are long in the West)</p>
<p>Through Las Vegas as well as Cedar Breaks, at times.<br>
And making them even longer by going through seldom visited towns such as Alamo and Caliente, Nevada.</p>
<p>In Alamo, we visited Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Martin Cox who used to live near us.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230426 30 year friendship/cox.JPG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Once, they invited our whole family, including my parents and my mother-in-law to <a href="https://fortbridgerrendezvous.net/">Fort Bridger Rendezvous</a></p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230426 30 year friendship/bridger.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We were treated to meals, scenes, and experiences that we could not have on our own.</p>
<p>Thank you Pat and Mike and the rest of the Reid Clan for sharing part of your life with our family.<br>
We appreciate it very much.</p>

  <link>https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/2023040 Korean Fireside/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Met the parents of my mission companion.</p>
<p>The meeting was the post General Conference Korean Fireside hosted by the Korean Ward located in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/K9K92MyYesqxqGzH7">Orem Sunset Stake. 1260 S 400 W, Orem, UT 84058</a></p>
<p>As long as I can recall, Koreans have always met separately after the conclusion of the General Conference.</p>
<p>I remember as a missionary, seeing a contingent from Korea addressing Korean Saints in the LA area. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hQdrMkvAeuq8dHPNA">LA Olympic Korean Ward. 1209 S Manhattan Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90019</a></p>
<p>Also during the early 1980s, visitors would meet in the old <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DiaG6HkGJqysDiMu8">7th East Building. 2450 S 600 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84106</a></p>
<p>As the Korean Branch/Ward expanded during the last couple of decades, meetings have been held in various buildings in the Edgemont Area of Provo, as well as in Midvale. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DX7zWVgvmpjM4CGr5">8350 Jackson St, Midvale, UT 84047</a></p>
<p>I don’t recall much of what was said by speakers in those gatherings. I do remember meeting old friends and meeting new acquaintances A warm feeling of being with fellow believers and hearing comforting words in language of my father and mother.</p>
<p>Any other group would say 5 sessions and nearly 10 hours of gospel-centered messages would be sufficient.</p>
<p>Not Koreans.</p>
<p>They want to hear directly from their leaders A statement of those principles in their native language. As well as soak up any and all Korea related news.</p>
<p>As a bonus, this year, an Area 70 from Japan attended. Elder Imai said, he found out that his ancestors were from Korea</p>
<p>Format and people attending has changed over the years. But there are few families and individuals that did not change over time</p>
<p>My mission companion, Elder Pak, was from North Ogden. He is the youngest of 6 children and the only son in the family.</p>
<p>Also met the husband of his oldest sister. 김상현. He mentioned that E. Pak is doing quite well as an orthopedic surgeon. Owns 2 hospitals and 2 homes in Buena Park and Huntington Beach. His daughter chimed in, “He is in Peru now, arranging a bike ride back to US”</p>
<p>Thought to myself, my companion has done real well.</p>
<p>Then the daughter mentioned their mother has dementia and has moved in to help out.</p>
<p>If she hadn’t mentioned it, I would not have realized, since she recalled and we talked normally about past events.</p>
<p>As I talked to the father more, I realized he sounded a lot like my own father.</p>
<p>So I ventured and asked where he is from. He said, he has lived in Incheon but he is originally from 함경도 Hamkyung Do. Just few miles from my father’s hometown. (he lived about the same distance as Ogden to Provo).</p>
<p>For a few minutes, thought I was listening to my own father speaking. That unmistakable pattern or 사투리 (억양 抑揚 or intonation) that only North Koreans from 함경남도 (咸鏡南道) area can express..</p>
<p>Thank you Paks. Thank you Father.</p>

<p>Received another round of gift from above – moisture – in the form of mixed precipitation or sleet.</p>
<section id="magical-winter-scenes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="magical-winter-scenes">Magical Winter Scenes</h2>
<p>Earlier in the month, wife asked,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Are you getting tired of removing snow from the sidewalk?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could have agreed with her, Instead I said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I enjoy shoveling snow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since each snowflakes are unique Each storm brings, slightly different type of snow. Each snow removing session is also unique and a strategy driven event.</p>
<p>Use the <code>shovel-and-throw-over-shoulder</code> approach or the <code>plow-until-you-can't-push</code></p>
<p>It is magical how snow reaches the ground and covers everything.</p>
<ul>
<li>How are layers of snow deposited on surfaces?
<ul>
<li>It it temperature driven?</li>
<li>Is there a industrial equivalence?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which factors determine rain, freezing rain and snow?</li>
</ul>
<p>[Not only the scene but the sound changes after snow, things are more serene and quieter.]</p>

<section id="decisions-short-vs-long-term" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decisions-short-vs-long-term">Decisions : Short vs Long Term</h2>
<p>There are short term decisions. Where to dine, which country to visit, who to date.</p>
<p>Then there are longer term decisions. Which food to avoid and how much to intake, which neighborhood to set up home, who to commit to and live this life together.</p>
<p>The decision to live in Utah, with its long and snowy winter, was made decades ago.</p>
<p>Decided to take spring wild flowers, summer heat, fall foliage, as well as the winter storms.</p>
<p>(Thus gladly accepting inches of gift of moisture in a high desert),</p>
<p>Rather than judging a place by short visits, there are many who made decisions to make Utah their home.</p>
<p>As well as those that have decided that desert southwest will be their home - year round.</p>
<p>As my sister in Arizona says,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Arizona has summer months, and Utah has its winter months, as burdens to bear.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflecting-on-removing-snow">Reflecting on removing snow</h2>
<p>There was time when I wished for snow to plow – lots of it.</p>
<p>Having a snow plow equipped, 4-wheeler meant, snow removal was something to look forward to.</p>
<p>Now days, if someone offered to clean my sidewalk, wonder how I would respond.</p>
<ul>
<li>how would I spend the time saved</li>
<li>lose out on the opportunity to exercise</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a great feeling to see the clean sidewalk, that would take less than 30 minutes to clear.</p>
<p>The warm weather is most effective means of snow removal.</p>
<p>One develops sense of when to pick up the shovel, or wait on benevolence of neighbors or nature.</p>
<p>As I grow older, hope that I have the strength and fortitude of this gentleman in Park City.</p>
<p>[Vic, in his 90s, is a former miner that lives near the ski area]</p>

<p>Want to thank my parents for taking away the fear and stigma associated with getting old and facing death.</p>
<p>Our family was small growing up, on my mother and father’s side. Most family members stayed in North Korea, because everyone thought the War and the separation will be short lived.</p>
<p>Growing up, I saw funeral procession on the street or on TV for one of the relatives of the last monarch.</p>
<p>Most everyone I knew were young and vibrant.</p>
<p>Then our family moved to United States, where I was further removed from pain and suffering associated with death. After turning 20 did I learn that some of the relatives have passed away.</p>

<p>First death of a family member, that I attended, was in the year I turned 37.</p>
<p>At the time I was working in Daegu and my grandmother lived in Incheon.</p>
<p>My maternal grandmother passed away at aged 87, who lived without her husband for nearly 60 years, after suffering from dementia. My aunt lovingly took care of her at home and she looked happy and well taken care of until her passing.</p>
<p>Felt the sorrow of 4 surviving sisters. My mother is the oldest and one that knows, intimately challenges of growing up fatherless. Adding to the sorrow was that her only son passed away when he was in his 40s.</p>
<p>Took on some of the male role that would be handled by male heirs. Felt the sorrow of family members as she was laid to rest.</p>
<p>The ceremony was done according to Christian traditions.</p>

<p>My father’s mom, passed away a year after we returned to US.</p>
<p>My father’s youngest brother and his wife, took care of her for nearly 30 years. (it helped that uncle’s in-laws were trained nurses, they took care of grandmother before she became ill)</p>
<p>Similar to Kim Grandma, my grandmother also lost her husband, and lived alone for nearly 55 years.</p>
<p>My grandmother loved to farm and hike nearby mountains. She passed away at age 92. It was thought that, had she lived in the country, she would have lived another 10 years.</p>
<p>Through family connections, they were able to secure a proper burial place in the mountain. This is important in old Korean culture.</p>
<p>Was able to visit the grave site, two years later.</p>

<p>Both of my parents lived to be 90 years of age.</p>
<p>I am grateful that my parents, not only lived a full, long life but that they were able to communicate to us, until last days of their sojourn.</p>
<p>They were independent until the end.</p>
<p>They expressed their love and appreciation.</p>

<p>There were no fear of passing through to the next life. Only sorrow at the separation from loved ones.</p>
<p>Learned through their lives that living and passing on is both necessary yet beautiful part of the Plan. The Plan that enables us to be born again.</p>
<p>No longer fearful about the as-of-yet not revealed part of life and death.</p>
<p>For my parents and my grandmothers have shown how to live courageously and face death peacefully.</p>

<p>Jacob 7:26, Book of Mormon</p>
<p>My parents’ and my wife’s parents’ lives were as if a dream. They lived their lives mostly in solitary, lonesome world for them.</p>
<p>Through much tribulation, they tried their utmost against life’s challenges and left us a far better life.</p>

<p>When I was little, it was common to see those lost their parents to wear a marker on their clothes or on their hair. It was made from a particular clothes and shaped like a small bow tie.</p>
<p>In the olden days, a son was to build a shack by the tomb and spend 3 years of his life by the deceased. The logic was to pay back to parents what they did when we were little. 3 years of raising us, therefore spend 3 years of caretaker by the grave.</p>
<p>This type of reasoning did not survive the modern Korean thinking.</p>
<p>The introduction of Christianity and perhaps the increased practice of cremation may have brought about the certain demise of this practice.</p>

<p>A well know story about not listening to one’s parents is told through a story about a wayward green frog.</p>
<p>There was a green frog that did exactly the opposite of what he was told. The mother frog tried to change the son, time and again she failed. She turned old and was about to die.</p>
<p>She made her final request.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“When I die, please bury me on the bank of a river”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When she died, the son followed her words this time.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I always did the opposite of what she told me when she was alive,” he said to himself, “but now I will do exactly as she told me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The green frog sat in the pouring rain by the river bank, crying and crying for his mother. And that is why, to this day, the green frogs cry when it rains.</p>

</ul>
<p>I have never met my grandfather.<br>
We don’t have a photograph of my grandfather.<br>
We don’t have any records of my family, beyond my grandfather.</p>
<p>We know his name, Kang Hyun Yong</p>
<p>He was an only child and when his mom re-married, he almost assumed a new family name, Shin. However, even though he was not even a teenager, he wanted to and kept his original surname of Kang.</p>
<p>My mom told me that when she was expecting me she had a dream. In that dream, she met a bearded man in a mountain setting.</p>
<p>The man handed my mom a book. The book seemed to be a record. A record of the Kang Family.</p>

<p>My uncle’s search for his lineage met its dead end.</p>
<p>There are siblings that share the 항렬(行列).<br>
However since my grandfather was all alone, we could figure out his generations</p>
<p>Families that originated from North Korea were allowed to register their family records in 1957. Since many of the families had either left records behind, or some families may not have had family records.</p>
<p>My father assumed the role of the family head.</p>

<p>One day, was driving to meet June for lunch.<br>
Heard a voice on the classical FM station.<br>
The voice had characteristics not often heard in these parts yet the message was familiar and soothing.</p>
<p>The speaker spoke of the death of his father.</p>
<p>They were memorializing the eternal resting place, at the same time, recognizing that his father was not in that place but in the heart of that son.</p>
<p>Likewise fathers carrying grandfathers in his heart before him.</p>
<p>I needed to hear this personalized message.</p>

<li>Mothers: Sarah, Rebekah, Leah, and Rachel.</li>
</ul>
<p>I only know my father and know the name of my grandfather. We have been told that the all of the Kang family can trace their lineage back to General Kang of the 6th Century AD<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>I am not able to confirm if we started out as a Kang family. Perhaps we started our journey as many other families did — no surnames.<br>
Maybe we were indentured servants, bound to the land or authorities.</p>
<p>(My wife can trace their family back to China. An emissary from China stayed in Korea and became a predecessor)</p>
<p>I hope there will come a time when we have a full access to the family records. If that doesn’t happen in this lifetime, we will ponder on these words,</p>

  <title>7 Steps Up - 14 Steps Down</title>
  <dc:creator>DK</dc:creator>
  <link>https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230125 7 steps up/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>For the last 12 years of her life, my mother lived in a white brickhouse.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230125 7 steps up/IMG_6003 (1).JPG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The house was built on a slight slope, so that the east side of the house sat higher than the west.</p>
<p>It also meant, front of the house had 7 stair steps, where as it took 14 stairs to get to the basement. The basement opens up to the ground level on the west side.</p>
<p>From her kitchen, she could see the Y-Mountain. Mount Timpanogos can be seen from the living room.</p>
<p>Mother and Father would convert a yard with grass into a gardening area that produced vegetables year around, except for the winter.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230125 7 steps up/IMG_8081.JPG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It contradicted what I envisioned as a retired person. In fact, my mother farmed until the very last, worked during the season of growing.</p>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230125 7 steps up/LND_56A554AC-0CA4-4A0C-8F24-B8782149DB42.JPG" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>She was very independent. She would not use a wheel chair, no walker and definitely no canes for her.</p>
<p>However, during the last few months of her life, she could not negotiate those steps. In addition, the snowfall made it dangerous for her to walk to the curbside.</p>
<p>One option was for her to move downstairs. Basement had a direct access to outisde and the driveway, thus no stairs involved.</p>
<p>However, she would miss the sunlight that main level provided, especially on those cold winter days.</p>
<p>We discussed further.</p>
<p>The thought of sending mother to an assisted living was never brought up, since the thought never crossed our minds. We were united in keeping our mother at her home.</p>
<p>Then, my wife suggested the following.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…I will carry her on my back…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My mother is a small person, but still carrying a person down a flight of stairs is no simple task. Not to mention going back up those same 14 steps while carrying a person on the back.</p>
<p>In a small measure, we were able to give back all that our parents provided over the years.</p>
<p>Perhaps in a very small means, we were able to do unto others, things they are not able to do on their own.</p>

<p>My father didn’t express his feelings much. Like most men from his generation, less words the better.</p>
<p>Was surprised to discover journals kept by him, in his 80s.</p>
<p>My father spent 36 years in Maryland area. Then in summer of 2010, he sold his home and moved to Provo to be close to the grandchildren.</p>
<p>His life in Utah centered around the family and his God.</p>
<p>Daily activites were with the family and for the family. When good things happened, big or small, he thanked the source of all blessings - our God</p>

<p>There are multiple ways of living a record or legacy.</p>
<p>A visual medium such as video has multiple codec.<br>
A audio format has even more ways to encode data.</p>
<p>However, how many of these will survive and be interpreted by future generations.</p>
<p>The engraved or written record may be the most simple yet most enduring - precisely because of its simplicity.</p>
<p>While the world may search for the most accurate depiction of its surroundings and everyday occurrence, perhaps the most potent and effective means of preserving and passing on the values from one generation to another is used by the young and old alike – writing down the feelings of each moment.</p>
<p>Because, it is not the amount nor the accuracy that ultimately matters, but the feelings that the message conveys, and the impressions or imagery the message conjures up.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>"When you’re happy, you enjoy the music but when you’re sad, you understand the lyrics"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>― Frank Ocean<br>
</p>
<p>I have been contemplating lyrics lately.</p>
<p>Not necessarily because I am sad but because of my age and reflection on the days of our existence.</p>
<p>At a recent wedding, the couple danced to the music that accompanies these lines</p>
<p><em>I know your eyes in the morning sun</em></p>
<p><em>I feel you touch me in the pouring rain</em></p>
<p><em>And the moment that you wander far from me</em></p>
<p><em>I wanna feel you in my arms again</em></p>
<p>(How deep is your love?, Bee Gees 1977)</p>
<p>This was played during my high school days.</p>
<p><br>
A corollary to Frank Ocean's statement might be,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>When young, one dances to the music</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>When old, one contemplates memories invoked by lyrics.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>During high school days, we owned a record album called “Silk Degrees”<br>
</p>
<p>It produced 4 singles and the album peaked at #2 on Billboard charts.</p>
<p>Back then, listened to who controlled the radio station playlist.</p>
<p>(Also there were no way of finding the official version of the lyrics. At times, it may be advantageous to leave the lyrics ambiguous. Used to think, <code>learn not to pretent</code>, instead of <code>learn how to pretend</code>)</p>
<p>While the hit singles were up-beat and dance-ready, the one that I recall and listen now is</p>
<p><code>We are all Alone</code><br>
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Outside the rain begins And it may never end<br>
So cry no more, on the shore a dream<br>
Will take us out to sea<br>
Forevermore, forevermore</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Close your eyes and dream<br>
And you can be with me<br>
’Neath the waves, through the caves of hours<br>
Gone, forgotten now<br>
We’re all alone, we’re all alone</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Close the window, calm the light<br>
And it will be all right<br>
No need to bother now<br>
Let it out, let it all begin<br>
Learn how to pretend</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Once a story’s told It can’t help but grow old<br>
Roses do, lovers too, so cast Your seasons to the wind<br>
And hold me dear, oh, hold me dear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Close the window, calm the light<br>
And it will be all right<br>
No need to bother now<br>

<p>On official records, my mother’s birthday is listed as <code>20 February 1935</code></p>
<p>That is incorrect.</p>
<p>The year should be 1932 and furthermore, the date is according to the Lunar Calendar.</p>
<p>So the actual date, according to the Julian Calendar is 26 March 1932. <a href="https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/gts/time/calendar/pdf/files/1932e.pdf">HK Observatory</a></p>
<p>My father’s birthday is recorded as, 12 February 1930, we believe the year is correct.<br>
So his Gregorian calendar birthday is 11 March 1930. <a href="https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/gts/time/calendar/pdf/files/1930e.pdf">1930</a></p>
<p>The difference in birthday is due to 2 reasons.</p>
<p>First, the impact of man-made war.<br>
Second, a tradition of using old, agriculture, focused lunar calendar.</p>
<p>When North Korean refugees were allowed to re-register in South Korea, many chose to and amended their birth year. 2-3 years was common since that was the length of the Korean War<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In addition my mother was known as 황현실 黃賢實<sup>2</sup> until she was 42 years old.<br>
Then she was know as 강현실 姜賢實 until the latter part of her life.<br>
She then became 황현실 黃賢實 again, for the last dozen years, as she associated with fellow Koreans.</p>

<p>She has navigated through changes, some that were catastrophic, in this life. As well as variations in counting years and birthdays and a place to call a home.</p>
<p>Although she didn’t talk in detail, there must have been times when she struggled</p>
<ul>
<li>because she was a stranger,</li>
<li>with a language barrier, and</li>
<li>because she was fatherless.</li>
</ul>
<p>But to us and to the Hwang Family, she never changed.</p>
<p>To Hwang clan, she was a daughter, grand daughter, and a great grand daughter.<br>
For us, she was a wife, our mother, a grandmother and a great-grandmother.</p>
<p>In the end, all of struggles and discrepancies were swallowed up and wiped away and her essence is what remains.</p>
<p>A daughter of God, sent to Hwang Family as the eldest daughter.<br>
To help them through the occupation, communism and the war times.</p>
<p>A faithful follower of Christ, married into the Kang Family.<br>
To guide them through the post war poverty, to search and find the truth, and to re-establish the family in the land of promise.</p>
<p>Thank you, God in Heaven for sending our dear mother.</p>

<p>Communication between two parties can yield varying results.</p>
<p>Because of differing experiences and readiness, the difference between the transmitted and intended message may vary greatly.</p>
<p>My sisters often talked to our mother on different subjects and with different approaches or angles. Thus they had a different understanding and recollection of the same event.</p>
<p>There are times we rely on oral recollections over written versions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we resolve these differences.</li>
<li>How critical are these differences.</li>
</ul>
<section id="lessons-from-our-parents" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-from-our-parents">Lessons from our parents</h2>
<p>First we learn from parents by observing how they decide. We learn about the outcome of their decision and action.</p>
<p>Then we formulate our own direction in life based on their examples.</p>
<p>In recent memorial for our mother, all 3 siblings prepared remarks. Not one of us delivered the prepared message.</p>
<p>(The order of delivery also affected what messages needed to be filtered, since it was covered by other speakers)</p>
<p>Instead we all delivered another version of the message that we felt was more appropriate.</p>
<p>Learned the following</p>
<ul>
<li>prepare all you can beforehand</li>
<li>rely on the guidance from above</li>
<li>adjust the content and delivery to fit the promptings, the current audience and the latest situations.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was the prepared message for Mom’s Memorial.</p>
<p>My mother’s life can be categorized into 3 areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is Beauty All Around</li>
<li>Truth Shall Make You Free</li>
<li>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="there-is-beauty-all-around" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="there-is-beauty-all-around">There is Beauty All Around</h2>
<p>As a hymn suggests, we see the beauty all around us when we have love as a foundation.</p>
<p>She had a deep faith in Christ and we felt her love from the very early years in life.</p>
<p>Mother recognized beauty in all of God’s creations she witnessed or the people came in contact with.<br>
She loved people and things as they were and what they could become. No detail was too small or insignificant to her.</p>
<p>She created beauty, even when the environment was chaotic or unorganized.<br>
We had a loving home with order and cleanliness.<br>
She knitted numerous creations, she could see a picture and create a sweater, a hat or warm piece for your neck. We are sure all of you have at least one of her latest creation, the dish scrubber(scouring pad) or <a href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%88%98%EC%84%B8%EB%AF%B8">수세미</a></p>
<p>She could out produce any farmers, she and father would turn a patch of lawn into a plot of land any farmer would grade as A+</p>
<p>My sister and I were sent in search of wild onions or Dal Rae <a href="https://ko.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%8B%AC%EB%9E%98">달래</a> We went to Rock Canyon and climbed up rocks and risked our lives and we found them She planted wild onions on her farm and we were able to taste wild onions.</p>
<p>Still can taste the lettuce that she grew in spring and into the summer. By wrapping around any food and putting the special sauce she created, the taste was something that we all would cherish.</p>
<p>We didn’t dine out much when growing up. We thought it was because we were poor, and we were. But learned later on that our mom was well-known as a connoisseur and a creator of Northern Korean cuisine.</p>
</section>
<section id="truth-shall-make-you-free" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="truth-shall-make-you-free">Truth Shall Make You Free</h2>
<p>Mother had a tremendous curiosity for all things, especially people.</p>
<p>Recently while organizing her things.<br>
We found a number journals and logbooks that she detailed, well into her 80s;</p>
<p>her study of the gospel as a Sunday School teacher Also she chronicled her love of cooking in a recipe book.</p>
<p>She sought for the foundational knowledge on all she encountered She didn’t want to rely on others, she was independent thinker</p>
<p>She learned truth by study and from inspiration and she became free.</p>
<p>She took a special interest in all she met and especially the young and babies. She used to say, you know you have been around for a while when you can remember 3 generations that came before you and can see in person 3 generations that will carry on the legacy.</p>
<p>She would make that <code>special sound of joy</code> that only she can make whenever she met young people or babies.</p>
<p>She was able to think clearly and make quick and correct decisions. Amazed that she maintained this ability to the very end,</p>
</section>
<section id="i-can-do-all-things-through-christ-which-strengtheneth-me." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-can-do-all-things-through-christ-which-strengtheneth-me.">I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</h2>
<p>She believed in Christ. She lived as a follower of Christ. She lifted and reminded others that they are children of a Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>Not only did she make us feel loved and important but that we can accomplish anything.</p>
<p>When I was struggling in school and without direction and felt like quitting. She would tell me how she carried on even through the death of her father and the Korean War. She was telling me you can do this with faith in Christ.</p>
<p>Visited with our uncle, my father’s youngest brother who is 13 years younger than my father. He mentioned how mom elevated his status as a human being. She insisted that he finish college when only 20% of the population had college degree Also the per capita income in Korea at that time was $100 USD per person<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Through means only she could have figured out, She encouraged my uncle and he was able to finish his studies and he is indebted to our mother as we are</p>
<p>She showed us by being a wonderful mother, a faithful wife, and loving Grandmother.</p>
<p>She endured and showed us how to live this life fully and we must follow in her footsteps.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Korea">Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Catholicism was first introduced during the late Joseon Dynasty period by Confucian scholars who encountered it in China. In 1603, Yi Gwang-jeong, a Korean diplomat, returned from Beijing carrying several theological books written by Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit missionary to China<sup>1</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to my sister, mom’s family attended a synagogue, participated in the Baptist congregation, and joined a Prebysterian faith, by the time mom’s father was of age.</p>
<p>Hwang Family were always searching for the truth.</p>
<p>Even as the country turned ideologically communist, Christians and my mom’s family maintained their faith in God</p>

</div>
<p>My other sister told me about an uncle who escaped a firing squad. Communists gathered religious leaders and they were to face death as a group.</p>
<p>The uncle fell and pretended to be dead before the bullets hit the prisoners.</p>
<p>As other prisoners fell by the bullet, they wound up on top of him. He thought he had escaped death, until the bayonet check almost cost him his life.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>After 20 years of participating in Presbyterian faith, my mom, as her family before, was still searching.</p>
<p>My father met missionaries as they were street contacting in Incheon.</p>
<p>My mother had many questions that were answered by missionaries, a visit by Elder Harold B. Lee.</p>
<p>One day, as she was studying scriptures, she dreamed.</p>
<p>In that dream, she saw 2 books on a table. One was the <code>Bible</code> and the other was the <code>Book of Mormon</code> A hand was also shown and as the hand was waved between 2 books, a voice was overheard.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>These 2 books are equivalent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these experiences along with her faith enabled to accept the gospel as thought by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latte-Day Saints.</p>

<p>Recently gave up my access to Spotify Premium</p>
<p>Earlier, my son offered to include me in his Spotify Premium Plan.<br>
I was excited to explore a new music source.<br>
Thought I would learn about dozens of new artists and listen to 100s of new songs.</p>
<p>That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>I ran out of memory<br>
Or more accurately,<br>
I no longer have memories that matches current songs</p>
<p>Realized that musical experience is not only an investment in learning songs and lyrics, as well as the artist, but also matching songs to one’s life’s memory</p>
<p>옛 사랑</p>
<p>남들도 모르게 서성이다 울었지<br>
지나온 일들이 가슴에 사무쳐<br>
텅빈 하늘 밑 불빛들 켜져가면<br>
옛사랑 그 이름 아껴 불러보네<br>
찬바람 불어와 옷깃을 여미우다<br>
후회가 또 화가 나 눈물이 흐르네<br>
누가 물어도 아플 것 같지 않던<br>
지나온 내 모습 모두 거짓인가</p>

<p><code>Old Love</code></p>
<p>Alone, wandered and cried.<br>
Past events that won’t let go<br>
Open skies and man-made lights aglow</p>
<p>Remember an old name and a face<br>
Cold wind makes me tighten coat collars<br>
Remembering the past makes me regret, angered</p>
<p>Used to think looking back would be pain-free.<br>
Was that memory real?</p>
<section id="music-listening-pattern" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="music-listening-pattern">Music Listening Pattern</h2>
<p>I mostly listen to songs from my parent’s generation up to the time when I was in my 20s. (1940s-1980s)</p>
<p>They are about topics I understand and the music I can follow along and sing.</p>
<p>Recently found out that what I listen to has a name, it is called <code>Trot</code> (as in Foxtrot), Similar to Enka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enka">演歌</a></p>
<p>It is a well defined genre among Koreans, According to Wikipedia, its 2 main themes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>love and parting,</li>
<li>longing for a home</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transition-to-modern-k-pop">Transition to Modern K-Pop</h2>
<p>In 1990 when I visited Korea after marriage. My uncle commented,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“why is it that everyone is emphasizing dancing over singing…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I should have put my money on those talent agencies that cater to dancers.)</p>
<p>One element of Korean songs is a feeling of resentment; deep sorrow: A feeling of bitterness, deep resentment or sorrow that builds up in one’s mind from an unfair or regretful event.</p>
<p>Didn’t fully realize these singers are singing more than just songs but a longing or yearning for a place, time, or a person they once met but no longer able to.</p>
<p>In essence, trot songs are K-Drama presented in a 5 minute segment. Feelings, aspirations, and disappoints of each generation.</p>
<p>Within that longing lies a hope that one day will be realized. Until then, my generation will sing those songs not found on Spotify.</p>
