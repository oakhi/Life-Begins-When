<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>"When you’re happy, you enjoy the music but when you’re sad, you understand the lyrics"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>― Frank Ocean<br>
</p>
<p>I have been contemplating lyrics lately.</p>
<p>Not necessarily because I am sad but because of my age and reflection on the days of our existence.</p>
<p>At a recent wedding, the couple danced to the music that accompanies these lines</p>
<p><em>I know your eyes in the morning sun</em></p>
<p><em>I feel you touch me in the pouring rain</em></p>
<p><em>And the moment that you wander far from me</em></p>
<p><em>I wanna feel you in my arms again</em></p>
<p>(How deep is your love?, Bee Gees 1977)</p>
<p>This was played during my high school days.</p>
<p><br>
A corollary to Frank Ocean's statement might be,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>When young, one dances to the music</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>When old, one contemplates memories invoked by lyrics.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
During high school days, we owned a record album called “Silk Degrees”<br>
</p>
<p>It produced 4 singles and the album peaked at #2 on Billboard charts.</p>
<p>While the hit singles were up-beat and dance-ready, the one that I recall now is</p>
<p><code>We are all Alone</code><br>
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Outside the rain begins And it may never end<br>
So cry no more, on the shore a dream<br>
Will take us out to sea<br>
Forevermore, forevermore</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Close your eyes and dream<br>
And you can be with me<br>
’Neath the waves, through the caves of hours<br>
Gone, forgotten now<br>
We’re all alone, we’re all alone</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Close the window, calm the light<br>
And it will be all right<br>
No need to bother now<br>
Let it out, let it all begin<br>
Learn how to pretend</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Once a story’s told It can’t help but grow old<br>
Roses do, lovers too, so cast Your seasons to the wind<br>
And hold me dear, oh, hold me dear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Close the window, calm the light<br>
And it will be all right<br>
No need to bother now<br>
Let it out, let it all begin<br>
All’s forgotten now<br>
We’re all alone, all alone</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Close the window, calm the light<br>
And it will be all right<br>
No need to bother now Let it out, let it all begin<br>
Owe it to the wind, my love, hold me dear</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>All’s forgotten now, my love<br>
We’re all alone</p>
</blockquote>

  <title>Life’s Discrepancies</title>

<p>On official records, my mother’s birthday is listed as <code>20 February 1935</code></p>
<p>That is incorrect.</p>
<p>The year should be 1932 and furthermore, the date is according to the Lunar Calendar.</p>
<p>So the actual date, according to the Julian Calendar is 26 March 1932. <a href="https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/gts/time/calendar/pdf/files/1932e.pdf">HK Observatory</a></p>
<p>My father’s birthday is recorded as, 12 February 1930, we believe the year is correct.<br>
So his Gregorian calendar birthday is 11 March 1930. <a href="https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/gts/time/calendar/pdf/files/1930e.pdf">1930</a></p>
<p>The difference in birthday is due to 2 reasons.</p>
<p>First, the impact of man-made war.<br>
Second, a tradition of using old, agriculture, focused lunar calendar.</p>
<p>When North Korean refugees were allowed to re-register in South Korea, many chose to and amended their birth year. 2-3 years was common since that was the length of the Korean War<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In addition my mother was known as 황현실 黃賢實<sup>2</sup> until she was 42 years old.<br>
Then she was know as 강현실 姜賢實 until the latter part of her life.<br>
She then became 황현실 黃賢實 again, for the last dozen years, as she associated with fellow Koreans.</p>

<p>She has navigated through changes, some that were catastrophic, in this life. As well as variations in counting years and birthdays and a place to call a home.</p>
<p>Although she didn’t talk in detail, there must have been times when she struggled</p>
<ul>
<li>because she was a stranger,</li>
<li>with a language barrier, and</li>
<li>because she was fatherless.</li>
</ul>
<p>But to us and to the Hwang Family, she never changed.</p>
<p>To Hwang clan, she was a daughter, grand daughter, and a great grand daughter.<br>
For us, she was a wife, our mother, a grandmother and a great-grandmother.</p>
<p>In the end, all of struggles and discrepancies were swallowed up and wiped away and her essence is what remains.</p>
<p>A daughter of God, sent to Hwang Family as the eldest daughter.<br>
To help them through the occupation, communism and the war times.</p>
<p>A faithful follower of Christ, married into the Kang Family.<br>
To guide them through the post war poverty, to search and find the truth, and to re-establish the family in the land of promise.</p>
<p>Thank you, God in Heaven for sending our dear mother.</p>

  <title>Traditions of My Parents</title>
  <dc:creator>DK</dc:creator>
  <link>https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230122 Oral Traditions/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Communication between two parties can yield varying results.</p>
<p>Because of differing experiences and readiness, the difference between the transmitted and intended message may vary greatly</p>
<p>My sisters talked to our mother on different subjects and with different angles. Thus they had a different understanding and recollection of the same event.</p>
<p>There are times we rely on oral traditions over written versions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we resolve these differences.</li>
<li>How critical are these differences.</li>
</ul>
<p>First we learn from parents by observing. We learn about the outcome of their decision and action.</p>
<p>Then we formulate our own direction in life based on their examples.</p>
<p>In recent memorial for our mother, all 3 siblings prepared remarks. Not one of us delivered the prepared message.</p>
<p>(The order of delivery also affected what messages needed to be filtered, since it was covered by other speakers)</p>
<p>Instead we all delivered another version of the message that we felt was more appropriate.</p>
<p>Learned the following</p>
<ul>
<li>prepare all you can beforehand</li>
<li>rely on the guidance from above</li>
<li>adjust the content and delivery to fit the promptings, the current audience and the latest situations.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230122 Oral Traditions/20230111_171424-01.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This was the prepared message for Mom’s Memorial.</p>
<p>My mother’s life can be categorized into 3 areas.</p>
<section id="there-is-beauty-all-around" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="there-is-beauty-all-around">There is Beauty All Around</h2>
<p>As a hymn suggests, we see the beauty all around us when we have love as a foundation.</p>
<p>She had a deep faith in Christ and we felt her love from the very early years in life.</p>
<p>Mother recognized beauty in all of God’s creations she witnessed or the people came in contact with.<br>
She loved people and things as they were and what they could become. No detail was too small or insignificant to her.</p>
<p>She created beauty, even when the environment was chaotic or unorganized.<br>
We had a loving home with order and cleanliness.<br>
She knitted numerous creations, she could see a picture and create a sweater, a hat or warm piece for your neck. We are sure all of you have at least one of her latest creation, the dish scrubber(scouring pad) or <a href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%88%98%EC%84%B8%EB%AF%B8">수세미</a></p>
<p>She could out produce any farmers, she and father would turn a patch of lawn into a plot of land any farmer would grade as A+</p>
<p>My sister and I were sent in search of wild onions or Dal Rae <a href="https://ko.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%8B%AC%EB%9E%98">달래</a> We went to Rock Canyon and climbed up rocks and risked our lives and we found them She planted wild onions on her farm and we were able to taste wild onions.</p>
<p>Still can taste the lettuce that she grew in spring and into the summer. By wrapping around any food and putting the special sauce she created, the taste was something that we all would cherish.</p>
<p>We didn’t dine out much when growing up. We thought it was because we were poor, and we were. But learned later on that our mom was well-known as a connoisseur and a creator of Northern Korean cuisine.</p>
</section>
<section id="truth-shall-make-you-free" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="truth-shall-make-you-free">Truth Shall Make You Free</h2>
<p>Mother had a tremendous curiosity for all things, especially people.</p>
<p>Recently while organizing her things.<br>
We found a number journals and logbooks that she detailed, well into her 80s;</p>
<p>her study of the gospel as a Sunday School teacher Also she chronicled her love of cooking in a recipe book.</p>
<p>She sought for the foundational knowledge on all she encountered She didn’t want to rely on others, she was independent thinker</p>
<p>She learned truth by study and from inspiration and she became free.</p>
<p>She took a special interest in all she met and especially the young and babies. She used to say, you know you have been around for a while when you can remember 3 generations that came before you and can see in person 3 generations that will carry on the legacy.</p>
<p>She would make that <code>special sound of joy</code> that only she can make whenever she met young people or babies.</p>
<p>She was able to think clearly and make quick and correct decisions. Amazed that she maintained this ability to the very end,</p>
</section>
<section id="i-can-do-all-things-through-christ-which-strengtheneth-me." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-can-do-all-things-through-christ-which-strengtheneth-me.">I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</h2>
<p>She believed in Christ. She lived as a follower of Christ. She lifted and reminded others that they are children of a Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>Not only did she make us feel loved and important but that we can accomplish anything.</p>
<p>When I was struggling in school and without direction and felt like quitting. She would tell me how she carried on even through the death of her father and the Korean War. She was telling me you can do this with faith in Christ.</p>
<p>Visited with our uncle, my father’s youngest brother who is 13 years younger than my father. He mentioned how mom elevated his status as a human being. She insisted that he finish college when only 20% of the population had college degree Also the per capita income in Korea at that time was $100 USD per person<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Through means only she could have figured out, She encouraged my uncle and he was able to finish his studies and he is indebted to our mother as we are</p>
<p>She showed us by being a wonderful mother, a faithful wife, and loving Grandmother.</p>
<p>She endured and showed us how to live this life fully and we must follow in her footsteps.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ</p>

  <title>Faith of My Mother</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Korea">Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Catholicism was first introduced during the late Joseon Dynasty period by Confucian scholars who encountered it in China. In 1603, Yi Gwang-jeong, a Korean diplomat, returned from Beijing carrying several theological books written by Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit missionary to China<sup>1</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to my sister, mom’s family attended a synagogue, participated in the Baptist congregation, and joined a Prebysterian faith, by the time mom’s father was of age.</p>
<p>Hwang Family were always searching for the truth.</p>
<p>Even as the country turned ideologically communist, Christians and my mom’s family maintained their faith in God</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>My other sister told me about an uncle who escaped a firing squad. Communists gathered religious leaders and they were to face death as a group.</p>
<p>The uncle fell and pretended to be dead before the bullets hit the prisoners.</p>
<p>As other prisoners fell by the bullet, they wound up on top of him. He thought he had escaped death, until the bayonet check almost cost him his life.</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A Presbyterian Congregation in Incheon</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>After 20 years of participating in Presbyterian faith, my mom, as her family before, was still searching.</p>
<p>My father met missionaries as they were street contacting in Incheon.</p>
<p>My mother had many questions that were answered by missionaries, a visit by Elder Harold B. Lee.</p>
<p>One day, as she was studying scriptures, she dreamed.</p>
<p>In that dream, she saw 2 books on a table. One was the <code>Bible</code> and the other was the <code>Book of Mormon</code> A hand was also shown and as the hand was waved between 2 books, a voice was overheard.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>These 2 books are equivalent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these experiences along with her faith enabled to accept the gospel as thought by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latte-Day Saints.</p>

  <title>Songs of My Parents</title>

<p>Recently gave up my access to Spotify Premium</p>
<p>Earlier, my son offered to include me in his Spotify Premium Plan.<br>
I was excited to explore a new music source.<br>
Thought I would learn about dozens of new artists and listen to 100s of new songs.</p>
<p>That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>I ran out of memory<br>
Or more accurately,<br>
I no longer have memories that matches current songs</p>
<p>Realized that musical experience is not only an investment in learning songs and lyrics, as well as the artist, but also matching songs to one’s life’s memory</p>
<p>옛 사랑</p>
<p>남들도 모르게 서성이다 울었지<br>
지나온 일들이 가슴에 사무쳐<br>
텅빈 하늘 밑 불빛들 켜져가면<br>
옛사랑 그 이름 아껴 불러보네<br>
찬바람 불어와 옷깃을 여미우다<br>
후회가 또 화가 나 눈물이 흐르네<br>
누가 물어도 아플 것 같지 않던<br>
지나온 내 모습 모두 거짓인가</p>

<p><code>Old Love</code></p>
<p>Alone, wandered and cried.<br>
Past events that won’t let go<br>
Open skies and man-made lights aglow</p>
<p>Remember an old name and a face<br>
Cold wind makes me tighten coat collars<br>
Remembering the past makes me regret, angered</p>
<p>Used to think looking back would be pain-free.<br>
Was that memory real?</p>
<section id="music-listening-pattern" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="music-listening-pattern">Music Listening Pattern</h2>
<p>I mostly listen to songs from my parent’s generation up to the time when I was in my 20s. (1940s-1980s)</p>
<p>They are about topics I understand and the music I can follow along and sing.</p>
<p>Recently found out that what I listen to has a name, it is called <code>Trot</code> (as in Foxtrot), Similar to Enka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enka">演歌</a></p>
<p>It is a well defined genre among Koreans, According to Wikipedia, its 2 main themes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>love and parting,</li>
<li>longing for a home</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transition-to-modern-k-pop">Transition to Modern K-Pop</h2>
<p>In 1990 when I visited Korea after marriage. My uncle commented,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“why is it that everyone is emphasizing dancing over singing…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I should have put my money on those talent agencies that cater to dancers.)</p>
<p>One element of Korean songs is a feeling of resentment; deep sorrow: A feeling of bitterness, deep resentment or sorrow that builds up in one’s mind from an unfair or regretful event.</p>
<p>Didn’t fully realize these singers are singing more than just songs but a longing or yearning for a place, time, or a person they once met but no longer able to.</p>
<p>In essence, trot songs are K-Drama presented in a 5 minute segment. Feelings, aspirations, and disappoints of each generation.</p>
<p>Within that longing lies a hope that one day will be realized. Until then, my generation will sing those songs not found on Spotify.</p>

<p>From April of 1966 to January of 1970 my father worked in Đà Nẵng, Vietnam.</p>
<p>The employer was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMK-BRJ">RMK-BRJ</a></p>
<p>The initial contract was for 36 months and he renewed for another 6 months afterwards.</p>

<p>He was able to come home after 18 months, for a well-earned, 휴가, return home.</p>

<p>Not only did the work compensation allowed the family to be debt-free but it also enabled my father to deposit money at the Bank of America.</p>
<p>(this allowed him to apply for an employment at an US company without financial backing)</p>

<p>Dad would say later that this crucible was the financial and spiritual base that we desperately needed.</p>

<p>In many ways, Đà Nẵng, Vietnam, was our Egypt and we are very grateful to God and to our father.</p>

<p>A visit with old persons leaves one with,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>something to think about</p></li>
<li><p>a resolution to improve</p></li>
<li><p>something you never knew - about your self or life.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Especially, if that person lives far away and haven’t talked to you in years.</p>
<p>As part of the Lunar (Chinese) New Year celebration, mom and I called some of the relatives in Korea.</p>
<p>As my mom and her younger sister spoke, they started to sound just like characters from CLOY (Crash Landing on You).</p>
<p>Mom explained that my father’s family came down to South Korea nearly a decade early so they had a chance to pick up the Southern Accent.</p>
<p>My mom’s family, on the other had, came during the War so they didn’t have a chance to assimilate as a teenager.</p>
<section id="section" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section"></h5>
<p>Then my uncle, who is 13 years younger than my father, began to re-live the old days in Incheon area.</p>
<p>The house we lived in during my growing up years, faced a busy road, but it was situated about 2 meters below the road.</p>

<p>One day, a truck owned by the US military<sup>1</sup> ran off the road and crashed into our house.</p>
<p>My uncle and I were sitting near a portable stove <a href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EB%82%9C%EB%A1%9C">난로(暖爐)</a> in an extension of rooms called <a href="https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/topic/detail/8320?pageType=search&amp;keyword=%EB%A7%88%EB%A3%A8">마루</a>.</p>
<p>As the truck crashed into the house, its axle rested near the extended floor and my uncle and I were inches from the tire and the axle.</p>

<p>Hearing this story affected me for days.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230114 Displaced Person/IMG_2156.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I learned a new phrase.</p>
<p>실향민<sup>1</sup> - a displaced person.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They are people who are blocked from returning to their hometown freely after leaving their hometown. Refugees are also included.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a son of a displaced person.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>오늘도 걷는다마는 정처 없는 이 발길 지나 온 자죽마다 눈물 고였다 선창 가 고동 소리 옛 님이 그리워도 나그네 흐를 길은 한이 없어라</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>타관 땅 발벗어 돈지 십 년 넘어 반평생 사나이 가슴속엔 한이 서린다 황혼이 찾어들면 고향도 그리워져 눈물로 꿈을 불러 찾어도 보네</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>낯익은 거리다마는 이국보다 차워라 가야 할 지평선엔 태양도 없어 새벽 별 찬 서리가 뼈 골에 스미는데 어데로 흘러가랴 흘러갈 소냐</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was my father’s favorite song. He would sing out loud and I would sing along as well. I learned the melody even as a young person</p>
<p>Now that I am older, I read the lyric and understand some of the sowrrow of being a displaced person. A stranger in a new part of Korea and a foreigner in a new continent.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Today I continue to walk (wander) Walk aimlessly Tears welled up at every passing person.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is no rest for the wanderer</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230114 Displaced Person/IMG_3950.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I am grateful that my parents were able to meet and establish a home in a new land. That we are able to follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>My father during 1960s would travel to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Kyushu, Japan on his way to and from Vietnam. Many years later, I was able to visit these same region and my children also spent time at those locations.</p>

  <title>A Given Vocation in Life</title>
  <dc:creator>DK</dc:creator>
  <link>https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230110 thank you dad/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I felt a renewed appreciation and love for my father one morning.</p>
<p>I was thinking how many times he went to work when he preferred to be elsewhere.<br>
And while working, wishing he had a different vocation.</p>
<p>He never once hinted that his work was hard or difficult.<br>
He was a crane operator.<br>
He was able to separate the work from home.</p>
<p>Compartmentalize out of necessity.</p>
<p>When he talked about his Korean War days, we thought he was reliving a period of his life. Only recently we learned that it is one of the traits of a PTSD – not being able to let go or escape certain events or trials.</p>
<p>Thought of his stay in Vietnam during the 1960s as a work-vacation.<br>
Forgetting that nation was in a civil war.</p>
<p>He always mentioned it as a crucible and a mean God has chosen to free us from the worldly debt and introduce us to American culture and a gateway to finding the gospel.</p>
<p>If greatness is defined as being true to one’s responsibility, my father had it – in abundance.</p>
<p>Recently, my mom, told me how proud he was of me.</p>
<p>He rarely expressed it in words, but I felt it growing up.<br>
Even now, I feel his love and guidance.</p>
<p>I love you too, Dad.</p>

<p>But grandma Kim objected and insisted that her oldest daughter stay with her. As a compromise, the second oldest went to stay with the aunt. However, the bombing of roads and bridges meant that she couldn’t get back in time to join the family.</p>

  <title>Deers of Rock Canyon</title>
  <dc:creator>DK</dc:creator>
  <link>https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230109 rock canyon deers/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>At first significant snowstorm, each fall, my dad would look towards Timpanogos and ask,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Wonder where deers go for their food…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I didn’t know, I couldn’t answer so we moved on to a different topic.</p>
<p>Our family lived in Provo for nearly 40 years.</p>
<p>We have hiked Rock Canyon as a family.<br>
All of my children graduated from Rock Canyon Elementary.</p>
<p>This is our neighborhood and we know all there is to know about it.</p>
<p>That was an incorrect reasoning.</p>
<p>One afternoon, after parking the car at the Rock Canyon Park, I started a hike up to the Bonneville Shoreline Trail.</p>
<p>Noticed a truck with a scope pointed at a spot above the trail. My curiosity was piqued.</p>
<p>I didn’t have to ask much, the man anticipated my queries and explained in detail about the feeding pattern, places to watch, best times to see.</p>
<p>He knew so much about the deer herd of Rock Canyon. He showed me when to look (during mealtime), where to look (30-40 feet above the trail), and what to look for (herd of deer).</p>
<p>I had never seen a deer herd before meeting this man with a scope.<br>
Since meeting with and coaching from the man, I can’t avoid seeing the herd.</p>
<p>One day, during a snowstorm, I saw a group of deer, moving together on a well-defined path, along the south edge of the Squaw Peak, about 200 feet above where I was.</p>
<p>So what seemed like a rhetorical question by my dad, turned into a specific teaching moment for me about the survival of deer in the wintertime.</p>
<p>(Perhaps my dad, who has passed away, was gently influencing the man with the scope to teach me a thing or two)</p>
<p>So in this life, it seems, that one can pose a question or raise an issue and others may solve it for us. Or one can jump in and try to find, not only the answer, but also implement the solution once found.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><code>Talk given at Seneca Stake, Spring 2022</code></p>
<p>Hello brothers and sisters,</p>
<p>My topic today is <strong>Jesus Christ is my Deliverer</strong>, which is taken from <strong><em>Come Follow Me, Exodus Chapters One to Two</em></strong>.</p>
<p>There are many ways the Lord can deliver His children from the challenges in life.</p>
<p>When the ancient Israelites were in Egypt, they faced huge hardships.</p>
<p>They were slaves.</p>
<p>They were forced to do hard labor.</p>
<p>They had no hope for a better life.</p>
<p>So what did they do?</p>
<p>In Exodus Chapter 2, Verse 23, it reads,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“They cried … unto God” for help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Lord answered their prayers.</p>
<p>He remembered His covenant people and sent Moses to help free them.</p>
<p>Moses was a tool to guide the children of Israel to the Promised Land. Through Moses, who received authority from the Lord to act as His prophet, there were many miracles.</p>
<p>There is the story of Moses parting of the Red Sea to escape the Egyptians.</p>
<p>There is also the story of the people of Israel receiving manna, or bread, from heaven.</p>
<p>The Lord also told Moses to split a rock to provide water to the people in the desert, which Moses did.</p>
<p>All these miracles happened along the people of Israel’s journey back to the Promised Land.</p>
<p>The Lord physically and spiritually sustained them.</p>
<p>In a very significant way, the Lord guided my family to the United States of America.</p>
<p>In Ether Chapter Two Verses 9 and 12, it reads that the Americas is “a land of promise” and a “choice land.”</p>
<p>The Lord delivers us from our struggles and bad situations.</p>
<p>How do I know this?</p>
<p>Because He delivered my mother from living under a communist regime.</p>
<p>My mother’s family were Christians for three generations, at the time, but they lived in fear in North Korea.</p>
<p>Under the government, the ultimate punishments for Christian worshippers were being sent to do time in a hard labor camp or the firing squad. She kept her faith by praying daily at night under a thick blanket.</p>
<p>She was like the people of Alma in the Book of Mormon, who prayed in their hearts to avoid punishment from their enemies. He heard my mother’s prayers and I know that He answered her prayers.</p>
<p>During the Korean War some seventy years ago, her family and other refugees were evacuated to a safer area in South Korea, thanks to the assistance from the United States Navy. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>While the war raged on, my mother and her family rarely lost hope and constantly prayed for the peace in the land. She saw miracles on many occasions, such as when the meager rations lasted longer than expected and also when her family received help from strangers, countless times.</p>
<p>The Lord delivered my mother’s family.</p>

<p>When my father was twenty years old, he was drafted into fighting for the South Korean Army during the Korean War. He was captured and tortured by the enemy on at least three different occasions.</p>
<p>However, he managed to escape from his captors and reunited with his army unit each time. He told me countless times that he was led by the powerful impressions to know when and which direction to run during his escapes.</p>
<p>One time, after being captured, the enemy soldier told my father that he was “too young to die” and he was spared from execution.</p>
<p>I am thankful to the Lord that He delivered my father from certain death.</p>

</div>
<p>Having seen the horrors of war first-hand, my parents decided to emigrate to the U.S.</p>
<p>The Lord can deliver our family from difficult situations by inspiring a way to escape, in this case, emigrate to the chosen land.</p>
<p>My family has been blessed to be in this country and to be members of the Lord’s restored and true Church.</p>
<p>All of my children have served missions for the Church in Southern California and South Korea.</p>
<p>My nephews and niece have also served missions in New York City, Washington State, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan.</p>
<p>Don and I are serving in the Washington, D.C. North Mission.</p>
<p>It has been a great blessing to serve among the young missionaries and the senior missionaries. We have learned so much about the inner workings of the mission and how many sacrifices are made to do the Lord’s work here in this area, and also throughout the world.</p>
<p>I would not have guessed that we would be serving a mission in our home region if you had asked me several years ago. But here we are, and we are loving this opportunity to serve the Lord in order to pay Him back for delivering us from our trials.</p>
<p>Our prayers are with those in Ukraine at this time, and we know that the Lord will deliver them during these troubled and difficult times just as He did for my family in Korea. Though many Ukrainians are not of our faith, their faith has gotten them through the difficulties of war and they have declared that God sustains and supports them.</p>
<p>As the Lord declared, “Peace I give unto you.” He will bless us with peace and He will deliver us from our trials.</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants Section 84, Verse 88, the Lord told the early Saints that He will send angels to us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In closing:</p>
<p>I know that the Lord Jesus Christ has power to deliver me from problems and troubles just like He did with the ancient Israelites. I know my Savior lives and loves me. I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p>The number 38 is significant to all Koreans.</p>
<p>But for those born north of the 38 degrees latitude, it means far more.</p>
<p>It means longing for a home, that is beyond reach, in this lifetime.</p>
<p>My father’s home is 함경도 안변군 신모면 이남리 47 about 10 miles south of present day Wonsan (원산시, 元山市) Port. Located about 150 miles northwest from Seoul.</p>
<p>My father’s family was living in this remote part of Korea, when his maternal uncle, 김동훈 traveled by foot to find the family.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Uncle 김동훈</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The uncle convinced the family life would be better in the South.</p>
<p>My father’s family was settled in South Korea. He had a chance to work for a Japanese company</p>
<p>Few years later, when Japanese left, he became the owner of the home that belonged to a manager.</p>
<p>He was all of 15 years of age.</p>
<p>Later he was drafted in the South Korean army and was on a weekend leave when the fighting broke out on Sunday, June 25th, 1950.</p>
<p>(Father fought in major battles of Korean War and he wondered how he survived those battles)</p>
<p>Father thinks, had he remained in North Korea and had fought for the North Korean Army, he may not have survived the war.</p>
<p>Father always had appreciation for the uncle that sought out the family and led them to a freer and a land with more opportunities</p>
<p>아~~ 산이 막혀 못 오시나요<br>
아~~~~ 물이 막혀 못 오시나요<br>
다 같은 고향 (家鄉, 故郷) 땅을 가고 오련만<br>
남북이 가로 막혀 원한 천리(千里)길<br>
꿈마다 너를 찾아 꿈마다<br>
너를 찾아 삼팔선(三八線)을 탄한다</p>
<p>Ah, is the mountain in your way?<br>
Or is the river too wide?<br>
All are free to visit place of birth<br>
The blocked boundary makes mine seem a 1000 里<br>
Visit you in a dream and blame the 38th parallel</p>

<p>Been going through dad’s study area.</p>
<p>Letters, certificates, photos and some books.</p>
<p>Church books, <code>명상록</code> (瞑想録) by Marcus Aurelius, <code>Maxims and Proverbs of Old Korea</code> 한국속담 by Ha Tae Hung.</p>
<p>My parents had their favorite sayings.</p>
<ul>
<li>소문난 잔치에 먹을 것 없다
<ul>
<li>There is nothing to eat at a rumored feast</li>
</ul></li>
<li>젊어서 고생은 사서도 한다
<ul>
<li>people even pay for a hardship in their younger age</li>
</ul></li>
<li>양약고구(良藥苦口, 良 좋을 량, 藥 약 약, 苦 쓸 고, 口 입 구)
<ul>
<li>bad taste in mouth, good for the body.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>More importantly they taught by example, not only how to handle difficult situations but teaching that life is a long journey.</p>
<p>Grateful that they shared their life’s lessons and that guided my life and made it had meaningful.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“What words of wisdom can I give them<br>
How can I help to ease their way?<br>
Now they must learn from one another<br>

<p>Life is kind, it washes away and lets us forget pains and troubles, little by little.</p>
<p>Life is cruel, it also extinguishes memories that you want to hold onto, all at once.</p>
<p>However, a small trigger, a kindness can ignite a flood of memories.</p>
<p>Each day I am more keenly aware of passage of time and an eventual end of present engagement or the assignment.</p>
<p>Hence the increased awareness and appreciation of each sunrise and sunset</p>
<p>Increased fondness for friendship and shared memories.</p>
<p>In daily, or hourly struggles,</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wish for a credit for lost weeks, months, and even years, because of things that can’t be controlled.<br>
At times, I am glad that I can’t recall, with any details those forgettable moments.</p>
<p>I am satisfied that God knows and is in charge and I must submit to my lot in life.</p>

<p>Snowstorms before Christmas brings memories of years past, as a student — and a father.<br>
June and I had 2 children before graduating from school.</p>
<p>Around Halloween, we brought our 2nd child, a son, home to a 500 square foot apartment.</p>
<p>It was snowing.</p>
<p>Our daughter welcomed home her brother and played with a doll with black hair like her.</p>
<p>I should have been worried, no terrified, about finishing school. Also obtaining a job that would pay sufficiently.</p>
<p>June directed and took care of matters so that I can focus on school tasks and worry less about the future.<br>
Recently, have learned the steps she had to take to live on a student budget. We cut out even necessary things to get by.</p>
<p>One of the few entertainment options was a video/pizza place on Canyon Road.<br>
For a couple of bucks, one can order a plain pizza and rent a videocassette movie.</p>
<p>Glad that we didn’t have internet and social media those days.<br>
It forced me to stay in school and work with others to get the work done.<br>
Also, there were no distractions on what other people were making or doing.</p>
<p>Because of her effort, and some family support, I was able to complete school and find a job. I was happy to have job, not too concerned about the salary. It was another 7 years before my salary matched our needs.</p>
<p>Even now, I recall how she encouraged and comforted me and made sure that home was welcoming and had freshly prepared meal ready. Because of it I didn’t know how desperate the situation and bleak the future really was.</p>
<p>Now, those 2 children are raising a family of their own.<br>
They are supporting one another and establishing a home of their own.</p>

  <title>My Seminary Teacher : Remembered</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Three days from now we will celebrate the the most important birth in history some 2000 years ago to Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>But for me the the birth of the second most important person in my life occurred 91 years ago on this day to Clyde and Elva Carter in Orem, Utah.</p>
<p>Her name is Carol Jean.</p>
<p>Three months and twenty days ago she passed through the veil to return to her Heavenly Father.<br>
It was her time to go but not my time to let her go.</p>
<p>She has left huge hole in my heart.</p>
<p>I want to tell you some things about this beautiful feisty woman.<br>
She was quiet but tough.</p>
<p>She had a very clear sense how she should live her life and once she made up her mind to do something she did it regardless of circumstances.</p>
<p>Her son, David said of her</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“she had an unwavering belief in our potential to do whatever we set our mind to. I know her belief in me made a difference in my life.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And her belief in me made all the difference in my life and I’d like to tell you about it.</p>
<p>I had grown up on a small farm in Washington state and had not taken college preparation courses in a high school but instead had taken courses to prepare me to go back to the farm.</p>
<p>Following graduation I was working for a farmer harvesting sugar beets when the weather turned cold and froze the beets in the ground. Two of my friends returned from BYU for Christmas break and told me how nice it was at BYU.</p>
<p>I decided I’d had enough trying to dig frozen beets out of the ground and put my clothes into a cardboard box and took a Greyhound bus to Provo.</p>
<p>I didn’t plan to stay in school but thought that a few agriculture classes couldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>I just wanted to get out of the cold.</p>
<p>It turned out that my two friends were renting rooms in Carol’s home In Provo and they introduced me to her.</p>
<p>At BYU of course I signed up for agriculture classes and Dr.&nbsp;Thomas Martin was my advisor.</p>
<p>At the end of the quarter I was in his microbiology class and at the end of it he said</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Mr.&nbsp;Rawlins I would like to see you in my office”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being very shy and insecure I entered with trepidation wondering what I had done.</p>
<p>He said to me</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Mr Rawlins I’ve been observing your work and next quarter I don’t think you should take any more agriculture classes. You can learn all that by reading books. I think you should take Math, Physics and Chemistry classes and go on and get your PhD”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was completely shocked. This was the furthest thing from my mind.</p>
<p>By this time Carol and I were seeing each other occasionally and when I told her of this preposterous suggestion and that I thought Dr.&nbsp;Martin was out of his mind she did did not agree.</p>
<p>She had worked as a secretary for him and was aware of his success in helping students obtain advanced degrees.</p>
<p>She simply said</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“of course you should do it. You can accomplish anything so set your mind to do”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And she never wavered from her belief in my potential.</p>
<p>When the PhD diploma was issued it had my name on it but she was responsible for a huge part of it.</p>
<p>As I have looked back I realize that without the confidence I had gained from Carol’s belief in me there would have been no PhD.</p>
<p>I would not have returned to school and would have simply returned home and got some kind of a job. With my limited resources there is no question that I would not have been a successful farmer but would have probably ended up as a farm worker as many in my family had been.</p>
<p>What a special woman she is.</p>
<p>I literally owe my life to her.</p>
<p>And it’s impossible to know how many lives like mine have been changed by her example of personal courage and an unwavering belief in their potential.</p>
<p>What a blessing she has been to all us that have had the privilege of having her in our lives.</p>
<p>Our last six months living in a senior living center have been wonderful.</p>
<p>With no external distractions and relatively good health we have spent all of our time doing things together and have grown very close.</p>
<p>When Carol returned from rehab for her hip surgery where I could not spend the night we were so pleased to be able to be together.</p>
<p>On the morning a day before she died she rolled over and laid her head on my shoulder and said to me</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I love you Stephen. We are a team. We are tough cookies and together we can handle anything life brings our way”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with Carol’s example of strength and courage and the help and guidance of our Lord I know I will be able to handle whatever life brings to me including this temporary separation from her.</p>

  <title>shewed mercy and was a neighbor to strangers</title>
  <dc:creator>DK</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>My mother will be coming home in a few days.</p>
<p>She has been in the Utah Valley Hospital and Provo Rehabilitation &amp; Nursing since November 10th.</p>
<p>Grateful to dedicated workers, technology, and the grace of God.</p>
<p>For unknown reasons, her right arm began to swell and changed colors – to purple.</p>
<p>Workers performed blood tests, administered IV and blood transfusion and managed her pain.</p>
<p>Doctors at the hospital determined that acute symptoms have abated and discharged her to the rehabilitation facility across the street, to recover and to return home.</p>
<p>But her arm didn’t get better.</p>
<p>Although Rehab facility personnel tried their best with their given resources, my mom’s pain and the swelling increased.</p>
<p>As a last resort, her daughter-in-law pleaded with administrators to send her back to the hospital for evaluations – to find the cause.</p>
<p>A nurse from the radiology admission area came to take mom to the CT (computer tomography) Scan area.</p>
<p>When the nurse saw the condition of the arm, she changed the directive and wheeled my mom to the emergency area.</p>
<p>Because of the action of that nurse, mom was able to get both the CT Scan and the Ultrasound of her arm and increased attention on pain management.</p>
<p>The evaluations showed that there was a pseudo-aneurysm in her artery near the fistula.</p>
<p>The solution was to inject Thrombin into the area that was leaking blood.</p>
<p>The surgery was performed on the day before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>It was successful and mom avoided more invasive surgery.</p>
<p>Now she can begin the 4-week recovery.</p>
<p>Thankful to be living in a time and place that has access to the latest medical advancements. To live among men and women with the knowledge and practice medicine with wisdom.</p>
<p>To those men and women that responded and answered the prayer and pleading of the daughter-in-law and shewed mercy and was a neighbor to strangers - thank you.</p>
