<p><code>Talk given at Seneca Stake, Spring 2022</code></p>
<p>Hello brothers and sisters,</p>
<p>My topic today is <strong>Jesus Christ is my Deliverer</strong>, which is taken from <strong><em>Come Follow Me, Exodus Chapters One to Two</em></strong>.</p>
<p>There are many ways the Lord can deliver His children from the challenges in life.</p>
<p>When the ancient Israelites were in Egypt, they faced huge hardships.</p>
<p>They were slaves.</p>
<p>They were forced to do hard labor.</p>
<p>They had no hope for a better life.</p>
<p>So what did they do?</p>
<p>In Exodus Chapter 2, Verse 23, it reads,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>"They cried … unto God" for help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Lord answered their prayers.</p>
<p>He remembered His covenant people and sent Moses to help free them.</p>
<p>Moses was a tool to guide the children of Israel to the Promised Land. Through Moses, who received authority from the Lord to act as His prophet, there were many miracles.</p>
<p>There is the story of Moses parting of the Red Sea to escape the Egyptians.</p>
<p>There is also the story of the people of Israel receiving manna, or bread, from heaven.</p>
<p>The Lord also told Moses to split a rock to provide water to the people in the desert, which Moses did.</p>
<p>All these miracles happened along the people of Israel's journey back to the Promised Land.</p>
<p>The Lord physically and spiritually sustained them.</p>
<p>In a very significant way, the Lord guided my family to the United States of America.</p>
<p>In Ether Chapter Two Verses 9 and 12, it reads that the Americas is "a land of promise" and a "choice land."</p>
<p>The Lord delivers us from our struggles and bad situations.</p>
<p>How do I know this?</p>
<p>Because He delivered my mother from living under a communist regime.</p>
<p>My mother's family were Christians for three generations, at the time, but they lived in fear in North Korea.</p>
<p>Under the government, the ultimate punishments for Christian worshippers were being sent to do time in a hard labor camp or the firing squad. She kept her faith by praying daily at night under a thick blanket.</p>
<p>She was like the people of Alma in the Book of Mormon, who prayed in their hearts to avoid punishment from their enemies. He heard my mother's prayers and I know that He answered her prayers.</p>
<p>During the Korean War some seventy years ago, her family and other refugees were evacuated to a safer area in South Korea, thanks to the assistance from the United States Navy. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>While the war raged on, my mother and her family rarely lost hope and constantly prayed for the peace in the land. She saw miracles on many occasions, such as when the meager rations lasted longer than expected and also when her family received help from strangers, countless times.</p>
<p>The Lord delivered my mother’s family.</p>

</div>
<p>When my father was twenty years old, he was drafted into fighting for the South Korean Army during the Korean War. He was captured and tortured by the enemy on at least three different occasions.</p>
<p>However, he managed to escape from his captors and reunited with his army unit each time. He told me countless times that he was led by the powerful impressions to know when and which direction to run during his escapes.</p>
<p>One time, after being captured, the enemy soldier told my father that he was “too young to die” and he was spared from execution.</p>
<p>I am thankful to the Lord that He delivered my father from certain death.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Having seen the horrors of war first-hand, my parents decided to emigrate to the U.S.</p>
<p>The Lord can deliver our family from difficult situations by inspiring a way to escape, in this case, emigrate to the chosen land.</p>
<p>My family has been blessed to be in this country and to be members of the Lord’s restored and true Church.</p>
<p>All of my children have served missions for the Church in Southern California and South Korea.</p>
<p>My nephews and niece have also served missions in New York City, Washington State, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan.</p>
<p>Don and I are serving in the Washington, D.C. North Mission.</p>
<p>It has been a great blessing to serve among the young missionaries and the senior missionaries. We have learned so much about the inner workings of the mission and how many sacrifices are made to do the Lord's work here in this area, and also throughout the world.</p>
<p>I would not have guessed that we would be serving a mission in our home region if you had asked me several years ago. But here we are, and we are loving this opportunity to serve the Lord in order to pay Him back for delivering us from our trials.</p>
<p>Our prayers are with those in Ukraine at this time, and we know that the Lord will deliver them during these troubled and difficult times just as He did for my family in Korea. Though many Ukrainians are not of our faith, their faith has gotten them through the difficulties of war and they have declared that God sustains and supports them.</p>
<p>As the Lord declared, "Peace I give unto you." He will bless us with peace and He will deliver us from our trials.</p>
<p>In Doctrine and Covenants Section 84, Verse 88, the Lord told the early Saints that He will send angels to us:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>"And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In closing:</p>
<p>I know that the Lord Jesus Christ has power to deliver me from problems and troubles just like He did with the ancient Israelites. I know my Savior lives and loves me. I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
